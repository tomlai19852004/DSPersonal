Number one is the biggest problem with artists today. In fact, the reason I was inspired to write this post was because I had recently interviewed for a position but was passed up by another candidate who had been doing the work for free. Thus, is the fallacy of nonprofits. However because I hold myself at a certain standard, in the end I know wherever I end up will be more fruitful. It is easier to get a job for free as an artist, so it is even easier to get into the cycle of working for free for résumé space. But until you are confident enough to put a pricetag on your work and are able to justify it with the advantages that make you the unique individual that stands out from the rest — no one will honor what you deserve.Don’t starve.Work, create, survive.
