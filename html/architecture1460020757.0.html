The Maqam EchahidArchitecture Spotlight: Algeria (Maqam Echahid, Samia Henni and Prof. Karim Hadjri)One of my favorite scenes in my upcoming novel is set in Algeria during the Cold War tensions of the 1950s. Algeria itself has always been a nation at the crossroads between the East and West primarily due to its optimal strategic position for trade, and as such has been invaded and influenced by a number of cultures (e.g. Phoenician, Arab, French). Algeria’s architecture over the years has reflected this unique amalgamation of culture, and even though it suffered cultural setbacks due to the civil war that spanned over much of the 90s, it has still produced some noteworthy structures and architectural visionaries. For this post we shall highlight the Maqam Echahid, Samia Henni &amp; Prof. Karim Hadjri.Maqam EchahidAlgeria’s struggle for independence from France was an ongoing war that lasted from 1954–1962. Thousands of lives were lost, and it was a period of great pain and suffering for many on both sides of the conflict. The Maqam Echahid (aka ‘Martyrs Memorial’) is an impressive civic monument in Algeria’s capital (Algiers) that was completed in 1982 to honor the men and women that died during the Algerian revolution. Directly underneath the structure (underground) sits another important Algerian landmark, the Museum of the Revolution. Developed by the Canadian based engineering/construction company, Lavalin, the primary architect of the structure was Bashir Yelles, who collaborated with a team of engineers and artists on its design, most notably the Polish sculptor Marian Konieczny.The structure itself stands at 302ft. Its shape consists of three standing palm leaves with a statue of a soldier at each base. The palm leaves shelter the “Eternal Flame” beneath, and each soldiers statue represents a different phase in Algeria’s struggle for independence.Samia HenniSamia Henni is an architect and academic of Algerian origin. Born in Algiers, she studied architecture in Algeria and Switzerland, and has lectured and delivered exhibitions in a number of countries around the world, including Ghana, England, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece and Portugal. She has a strong research background and in many respects is a historian as well. She’s an astute critic within the architecture community, and has participated in a number of research projects around the world. Check out the video below to watch Samia and Magda Bendani, another architect from Algeria speak on their inclusion in the 2012 Backstage Architecture Survey:Professor Karim HadjriProfessor Hadjri is the academic lead for architectural studies at the University of Central Lancashire in England. He has worked as a scholar, adviser and researcher in many countries, including the UAE, Colombia, England and Saudi Arabia. His more recent research is focused on how to make care homes more ‘friendly’ for dementia sufferers, an undertaking I personally find quite interesting. Check out this radio interview to hear some of his views on this subject:Algeria is one of many locations featured in my novel, Eteka: Rise of the Imamba.
