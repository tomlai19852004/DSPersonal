Starving Artists Gonna StarveMuch of what we say and do seeks feedback from the rest of the world. This desire for immediacy is especially true of artists and advertisers.I grant that the saturation of ads and emoji into language might seem silly when approving neanderthals can decode our techno-hieroglyphics. To an average caveman, advertiser or artist, symbols might seem to be regressing language and art into the dark ages. I was even told recently by an artsy friend, “Identity is now Everything. Art is being advertised out of existence.”You artists. You always return to purity of art bullshit. I see why it makes sense to plot poem versus tweet, masterpiece making versus selling out, but you’re going to war when there is infinite open space. Not to mention, your potential audience is global, all mankind.Increasingly, in our phone-centric lives, convenience is key. Texts and updates are read then swiped away as if the OS is evolving to anticipate our need to context shift from driving or texting, working or living, producing or consuming. If art is going to matter at all then it’s going to have to find some competitive advantage to capture our attention (it can’t) or adapt. Don’t ask me how exactly. I have only figured out the first part: sell out.I can appreciate the mindlessness of finding beauty too often and too readily: the authentic Miranda July who thinks she’s just like RiRi.Miranda July is almost adorable, but RiRi is adorable. IMAGE: TMAGAZINEArt can’t survive as a echo chamber or as a guardian fighting off technology or as a starving artist brewing resentment. The echo chamber of artists need to inhale and digest tech, or else starving artist gonna starve.RiRi knows: #bbhmm.Of course, you don’t need that many moneys to adapt and grow a tech identity. Twitter is a free tool for instant global communication. I’m not complaining about the zero cost of admission model, but there is a catch. We lend our reputation and become ads that our friends swipe away. Sometimes we retweet and shout simple shallow things to see if anyone is listening, but mostly I just check in with the adorablest.History major, Bloomberg’s Alix Steel is the adorablest. IMAGE ScarletfuI refuse to follow my friend into his crusade against Twitter. I refuse to fight for art. Fights seem violent. Some worry this failure to fight will be the death of art, but why worry when bohemians, painters, and would be writerly souls are still out for immortality?The hustling writers will submit to submittable. The artist has always had to suck it up, sell out for meals, and produce challenging work on the side. I mean, selling out is how the opera is still a thing and print media novelist Tom Wolfe is buying priceless art at Sotheby’s. Don’t get me wrong, I dream of subsisting on typewritten manuscripts, librarians, of being a man of letters:“The thrill of entering a private space, where the characters are unaware they are being watched. … Letters are different from e-mails and texts. They have stuff jotted in their margins; they reveal a bit more about the writer. And with nothing in them to click on, the words have to do a lot more work, to enable the reader to see what you mean.” (Lewis, 2015)But hopefully what we lose in the margins is regained in things like immediacy and ease of picking up a Gmail conversation left off in 2009. I’m old enough to have felt social stigma for seeking connection online and I remember the always idling AOL instant messenger socialites that seemed to arrogantly taunt me with their complete AFK-ness. I could easily be of mind to push back against the babymakers and yelpers with their ego growth measured in diaper count and their food porn stretching my cultivated net of Facebook likes with spawn and spam musubi tastings. Although I strangely hope to be that proud of my dinner someday too, there isn’t some AFK world of people who eat better, read better or fly faster. We all tell ourselves a good lie: someone else has it better, but I matter.The astronaut’s job could be done — was done — by a monkey. By the old standards — the true standards — the astronauts weren’t even flying. The job was to sit still and cooperate with technocrats — and not alert the wider public that whatever you were doing required any less of the right stuff than it had before. The space program vaulted the astronauts to the top of the heap and reduced Chuck Yeager to an afterthought. The world needed them to be heroic pilots, and so they played the part, but no one (except for one American writer) thought to look more deeply into the matter. No one noticed the best story. Process had replaced courage. Engineers had replaced warriors. A great romantic way of life, a chivalric code, had been trampled by modernity. Not for the first time! (As Wolfe might write.)” (Lewis, 2015)Dreamers. We are the Thing To Shake Fists At. We believe we are central here. But time is the universal fist that dismisses us all. And as we cruelly consider the leftover possibilities, this is the new shape of the profound:I’ve read slush pile cover letters from both MFAs and STEMs. In them, I find desperation and likeness and optimism. Everyone’s read Love in the Time of Cholera or Wild or Middlesex because of Oprah, and George Saunders or Edan Lepucki because of Colbert. We hate to identify ourselves with the privilege we come from. And we hate even more when the mainstream shares our privileged interests. Therefore no one is a hipster except for all hipsters who are trying so hard to not be hipsters:“ Why, if he wasn’t the kind of gentle holy fool that he’s often portrayed as today? Why did people respond to him the way they did? I think there are a few reasons. First, I think he really loved wrestling. Second, he didn’t try to pretend that he made any sense. Wrestling is, in the classic Barthesian reading, a theater whose purpose is to restore the moral intelligibility of the universe — the heroes are obviously heroic, the villains obviously villainous, the signs and their meanings unambiguously fused.” (Phillips, 2015)Advertisers gonna Ad. Andre the Giant gonna Andre. Artists gonna Art. Jeff gonna Jeff. All of this is to say, when the universe is telling you to art, then go ahead and art. When your stomach is telling you to eat, what else are all the eggplants for?
