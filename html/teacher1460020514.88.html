Elizabeth: One of the really powerful things about your book is that you write about successful countries but you also reverse engineer how they got there. So I’m curious about how you think we could apply the turning points that happen in other countries to the US.Amanda: Every country has different obsessions. In the US, partly because of federalism, we have no central government that can really create coherence. The Feds just keep pushing the one button they have—which is accountability. This idea that if we can just put more pressure on schools, they will produce.Every country has tests. In fact, kids in Finland complain about the amount of testing they have in high school. These are all teacher-designed tests, not bubble tests.We tend to invest in quantity over quality in the US—not just in testing but in homework, in class size, so many things. Unfortunately it chips away at the credibility of the whole institution. If you’re in third grade, and you spend all this time preparing for and taking a stupid test—and you’re not even sure the questions make sense in some cases—then you start to say, “Aha, this is bogus. This institution says education is important but then doesn’t actually hold up its end of the bargain.” So it has this deleterious effect on kids’ motivation.A mural outside a high school in Busan, South Korea (Ripley)Elizabeth: I found it so interesting to go to Japan and ask, “Where is your accountability system? What’s your evaluation system?” And they sort of looked at me with a baffled look—not because they don’t have one but because it’s not called by that name. It’s a more mature system of helping people learn to do something and making sure that everyone can do it. I’m curious if you saw the same thing in other countries.Amanda: More countries are trying to introduce evaluation, which comes from a legitimate need to have more feedback for teachers. We’re not the only ones that have teachers in isolation. Spain is in some ways worse than we are. When you have not done the serious work of selecting and training teachers thoughtfully, you end up having to do all the work on the back end—which is unfair to teachers.The few countries that have invested upfront, like Finland, they’ve said, “We’re not going to drop you into some classroom with no tactics and no practice. We’re going to take it seriously.” And so not only does that mean that teachers are more prepared but it also sends a message to everyone in the country that this is for real. That is like gold. If you don’t do that, you end up doing all these highly inefficient, polarizing things—like top-down accountability reforms.Elizabeth: Absolutely agree with that. And these countries have a way for teachers to organize their day so that they have some time when they’re teaching, some time when they’re planning and some time when they’re observing their fellow teachers. These are just the basic building blocks without which you can’t get that higher-order learning.Amanda: So you’re saying it’s not just about making education colleges more serious; it’s about also putting in place the structures to make that work, to convert it into learning.Now before we finish, we have to talk about the dreaded C word. We both agree that the Common Core State Standards are a step in the right direction. Which means we will both get more hate mail just by my saying that.Elizabeth: Why don’t we just say a few other words?Amanda: Charter schools.Elizabeth: Bill Gates.Amanda: Oh yes. Pearson! So for normal people these sound like very benign words but in the education bubble they are fighting words.The last question that I wanted to ask you was about the Japanese lesson study—watching each other teach. They have these public ones that sometimes, for famous teachers, thousands of people will come. That to me was so exciting, and I guess I wonder, is it naïve to ask if we couldn’t do that here?Elizabeth: I’ve had a lot of joking conversations with teachers about what we could do. We could have America’s Next Top Teachers.In Japan they actually got inspiration from reality TV and did a spin on Iron Chef. So they had two teachers and instead of the same ingredients to cook with they were given the same topic to teach. And then they taught it in a different way, but the point was actually not competitive. It was like they wanted to have a live experiment.Amanda: Let’s do it. I think this is totally doable. The amount of money we spend on stupid things in education…Why not a reality teaching show? The idea of getting people to watch a teacher teach in a really masterful way and then talk about what she did would be one way to help Americans understand just how cool this could be.Elizabeth: We’ll do that together.
