Icons, Award-Winners and Oddities: A Guide to the Architecture of East LondonWe’ve always known that there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to East London.Sure, there’s a lack of glass and concrete towers around every corner — but this part of the city more than makes up for the absence of those bland blocks with architecture of a much more diverse kind.Positively brimming with personality, style and flair, East London’s architectural language comes out on its own — and it’s one that we really love. So let’s take a closer look at some of its brightest stars — usually hidden in plain sight!The IconsShoreditch UndergroundYes, an old underground station.No, nothing like anything you might expect.This former station stop (you won’t be crowding in with commuters on the way into work from this station) was permanently closed in 2006, when it bid adieu to the last train to grace its walls.Thankfully, it got a new lease of life — instead of being abandoned to decrepitude. And it’s now a hotbed of creativity and ingenuity — perfect for its East London locale.Shoreditch Underground Station is now a popular venue that has played host to all kinds of things — from hot tub cinema screenings (bliss!) to awesome art exhibitions, hi-tech pop ups, underground eateries and amazing dance parties.The TEA BuildingThe TEA Building is another iconic bit of the Shoreditch cityscape — with its big old “Tea” sign perched on top — the beverage of choice for the creatives humming away inside!While to the undiscerning eye, it might just look like another boring office block — this one has a whole hidden history within its walls. It was originally built back in 1930s, as a bacon factory.And — fortuitously — it’s also right next door to the Biscuit building!The TEA building was turned into an air raid shelter during WW2, and having survived the onslaught of that time, it has since become home to all kinds of different creative minds working in the area. You’ll find fashion designers, fancy eateries, marketing agencies and the illustrious Shoreditch House (where you’ll find the Tomorrow &amp; Today team tinkering away) across its multiple floors.The BarbicanThe BarbicanDespite (or maybe because…?) once being voted “the ugliest building in London”, you can’t deny the fact that the Barbican — well, it has “presence”.While it might seem hard to believe now, the building originally came out of a utopian architectural dream, in the aftermath of the devastation caused by WW2, and took over a decade to build.But despite first glances, it actually has a lot more going on beneath the surface, making the Barbican a worthwhile place to visit, both as an architectural gem as well as for the heaps of cultural shenanigans usually going on inside.There are lots of surprises tucked away inside. Did you know there’s an enormous greenhouse across the fifth floor — brimming with all kinds of exotic plants? As the second biggest conservatory in the city, it’s a wonderful escape from grey city life.There’s also the Fly tower — with 69 metal bars spanning across, used to create moving panels and play sets.The Award-WinnersI’ll be the first to admit that Hackney and Architecture are not two words I would normally expect to see anywhere near each other in the same sentence.Throw in “award-winning” and I’d think I’d slipped down into some parallel universe.As it turns out though, Hackney’s been busy beavering away, knocking up surprisingly exciting and interesting little gems of architectural design. And since 2004, there’s been an actual, honest to goodness, shiny prize awarded to the very best buildings and spaces.To help you feel all clever and In The Know, here’s the scoop on four of this year’s winners:151 Church WalkThis isn’t just any old street with a bunch of houses thrown in as an afterthought.This is like some utopian vision of harmonious living from the future.151 Church Walk is a collection of houses that achieve one of the most seemingly impossible tasks for a London home — they give lots of space, and lots of natural light. Built on a former industrial site, the roofs of each unit are stepped and angled to not interfere with the natural light of surrounding buildings, in particular the ground floor light of the nearest neighbour.The result is something that feels spacious and welcoming, in the best possible way.Find out more: Drool in envy at the architect’s site: Mikhail Riches.The Gingerbread HouseWith a name like it came straight out of a fairytale, the Gingerbread House is, unsurprisingly, very good at telling you its story.And its story is something like this — once a former jewellery workshop space, the building is already clustered around lots of neighbouring buildings — neighbours who didn’t want something loud and showy, thank you very much.But the Gingerbread House wanted to be beautiful and exciting in its own way — so with some careful planning and execution, it did exactly that.Full of light and subtlety, it’s a space that will get any architecture buff worth her salt sighing wistfully.You too can sigh wistfully with longing by perusing the work of the genius architect behind it.The Writer’s ShedVirginia Woolf once wrote that every woman writer needed a room of her own to work on her literary masterpiece.Most writers would nod in heavy agreement.And nearly every writer in the world would be squirming in serious envy at the sight of this little space.Tucked away in a corner of the city, at the edge of a garden and the Hackney skyline, this space is pure magic. A simple stove and chimney fills the space with warm, toasty heat — perfect for pondering big ideas.Simple, modest décor and walls positively heaving with bookshelves result in a space that’s tailor-made for imagining and creativity.Want your very own Writer’s Shed? You might want to chat up these guys then.The UnusualTrinity Buoy WharfDid you know that London has a lighthouse?A bonafide “dramatic light against a dark storm”, kind of lighthouse?Us neither. In fact, the Experimental Lighthouse has been up at Trinity Wharf since 1864, when it was used to test out maritime equipment and train budding lighthouse keepers.But now that being a lighthouse keeper is not the most obvious of career choices these days, Trinity Buoy Wharf has since been transformed into the site of a more creative kind of light instead, with art studios, gallery spaces, and best of all, Container City — which is nothing short of awesome.All those clunky, slightly plasticky-looking shipping containers you see stockpiled in random industrial places? Imagine them piled up together, Lego-style, and turned into a massive, multi-colour structure instead, and you begin to get a snippet of the pleasantly strange architectural spectacle it forms.Mural on the Village Underground wallVillage UndergroundOk, it’s not exactly a subterranean mystery spot, but here’s why we love Village Underground.It’s made up of some of the potentially dullest spaces in the world (defunct Jubilee Line carriages) that have been given a truly awesome creative makeover.It’s entirely eco-friendly — from recycling old carriages into offices and studios, to using photovoltaic panels for power (no idea but they sound impressive) and even using organic paint to finish off.It has the most awesome mix of creative talent in one area — from writers and VJs, to film makers, musicians and others who can’t quite be pidgeon-holed.In short, it’s a brilliant space to explore, broaden your horizons and surprise yourself at just how spacious those cramped Tube carriages really are.The Tree HouseIf award-winning, awe-inspiring examples of contemporary design are your thing, then mosey on over to 200 Jubilee Street where you can see one of the most stunning transformations of a nineteenth century terraced cottage. With a Miyazaki-esque focus on greenery, the house evolves out of a beautiful tree-filled garden.It’s an actual home but lovers of architecture can gasp in wonder in closer proximity by taking a tour of The Tree House, as part of Open House London’s special events across the city.RoominaroomThe designers behind this strange little feat of architecture had a particularly pressing challenge to deal with.What do you do with an expanding family, with no room to go up — or out? Their response was to delve inwards.The Roominaroom is something straight out of Escher-tinted dream, with walls that seem to fold and warp impossibly, opening up into new spaces where you were convinced you had already met its limits. Sinuous, stunning and serenely magical, it’s definitely worth paying a visit to.Text by Miriam Pa
