Growing up as a gifted child, where I knew ALL the answers, and corrected the teachers from time to time, this correction is not only wrong, but infuriating. Because the child probably knows that 3x5 and 5x3 are interchangeable, the child probably knows that simple math is asking for equal values and not equivalency, and the child can probably multiply in her/his head, and is breaking it down for the teacher as a favor. Iâ€™ve met so many teachers that explain math so badly that kids get traumatized, and so many children that get discouraged by teachers picking on them without any good reason. This is not a computer science class, nor college linguistics class. This marking is just idiotic.
