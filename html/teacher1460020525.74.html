Turn on the radio this fall during the run-up to the state’s education superintendent race, and I guarantee you won’t hear political ads about revising the state’s “minimally adequate” standard for education, closing the performance gap between minority and white students, or attracting talented teachers to the ever-troubled Corridor of Shame. No, you’re more likely to hear unhinged screeds like this one:“Common Core is giving the seal of approval to turning public school classrooms into indoctrination camps, pumping anti-Christian, anti-American propaganda into the minds of public school children.”That’s from a YouTube ad for Sheri Few, a superintendent candidate who also runs a nonprofit organization that publishes abstinence-only “sex education” materials for schools around the state (and takes in millions of dollars worth of government grants to do it).Republican talking points have seeped into nearly every facet of our public dialogue on education. In the tight-budget year of 2011, when the Legislature had suspended its promise of annual salary increases for all teachers, Gov. Nikki Haley turned down $144 million worth of federal bailout money. That money was meant specifically to pay for the hiring and retention of teachers, but Haley said that “the solution to our education challenges is not a federal bailout” — and State Superintendent of Education Mick Zais agreed with her. Responding to a plea from the U.S. Department of Education to accept the funds, Zais accused a DOE official of trying to “inject Washington politics into South Carolina’s affairs.”Consider the following anecdotes from just the past year in Palmetto State school politics:Operating on a sort of home-rule theory for school districts, Superintendent Zais asked the State Board of Education to support a bill that would eliminate caps on classroom sizes, put limits on teacher workloads, and institute minimum requirements for the hiring of guidance counselors, among other regulations. The proposal passed with almost no discussion on a first reading, but after public outcry swayed the opinions of most boardmembers against it, Zais scrapped his plan. Still, he took the time to accuse his myriad critics (mostly teachers) of “pure, partisan politics.”During budget discussions this year, state lawmakers took an interest in micromanaging book selection at USC Upstate and the College of Charleston. The House voted to cut a total of $69,000 from the two schools’ budgets because their respective freshman reading programs had distributed copies of the LGBTQ essay collection Out Loud: The Best of Rainbow Radio and the lesbian coming-of-age memoir Fun Home to first-year students. This sparked a backlash from students and faculty, who have been sparring with state Rep. Garry Smith over the issue ever since.From http://gayfacesgayplaces.tumblr.com/Sen. Fair (a common denominator in many of the state’s more embarrassing press outings) sent an updated set of high school science standards back to subcommittee because he thought the section on biological evolution was too pro-evolution. The controversy blew over quickly, but not before Superintendent Zais backed up Fair’s position in a comment to the (Charleston, S.C.) Post and Courier, saying, “We ought to teach both sides and let students draw their own conclusions.”We in the media have given the political demagogues exactly what they want. Even when a kerfuffle like the evolution issue ends in a matter of days, the most outspoken officials get their time in the limelight, and they get their message broadcast: Your kind (read: gays, unionizing teachers, people who agree with scientific consensus, etc.) isn’t welcome here.One reading of these stories is that we’re a backwater and our politicians don’t know any better. Another interpretation is that our leaders are sinister. As one Charleston teacher put it to me during Superintendent Zais’ deregulation blitz, “They’re coming from this small-government mindset: Get it down so you can drown it in the bathtub.”I don’t think Republican lawmakers in my home state are sinister, though. Southern conservatives are nothing if not sincere, and they earnestly believe that they’re doing what’s best and speaking up for morality. Problem is, they’re using a teacher’s desk as a soapbox.Paul Bowers is a reporter for the Charleston City Paper and is South Carolina’s weekly journalist of the year.
