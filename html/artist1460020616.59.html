A Portrait of the Artist: Andi MagenheimerAndi Magenheimer wearing VBA jacket.She’s known around the dive bars for her hand-painted portraits on jean jackets of unexpected, but entirely justifiable, denim heros. Tolstoy, Zizek, Michel Houellebecq, Nina Simone — even NY Times art critic, Roberta Smith have all been lovingly depicted, among a plethora of authors and auteurs. She also plays music under the name Dusty Mìller, calling the style “a kind of confused mixture of Linda Perhacs, Jandek, and vocal ideas stolen from Bulgarian folk singing, but my mom says I should call them Alien Ballads,” she adds with a laugh. But the main focus for the multitalented Andi Magenheimer has been traditional painting with oils.Her work delves into lyrical abstraction and interrogates modes of pictorial composition devised from social realist conventions. Bright cobalts, ultramarines, and cadmiums create slippages of depth — people and objects inhabiting and interacting with public or pastoral spaces turn into formal games and tricks of the eye. The scenes are often held together inside charmingly wonky framing devices of dry brush zig-zags and drippy, alizarin and ultramarine rainbow hearts, or explode outward from multiple planes constructed from clever manipulations and borderlands of staining and texture.Musing on the three major cities she’s lived in, “I was lucky to be a New Yorker first, just digging around for good music and art at these weird, amazing parties. I got my BFA at the School of Visual Arts in 2009, just when the market collapsed, so I taught in a high school in Westchester as an Artist in Residence — commuting up from Brooklyn three or four times a week while working as an artist’s assistant for Tauba Auerbach, Suzanne Joelson, and Gary Stephan, which set me up to go to the Royal College of Art. London was incredibly good for my work, even though it was difficult to get acclimated at first. When all my visa options ran out I fled to LA, where I just kept painting and started playing shows again. I was getting encouragement there from a few people like Habib Zamani, who runs PØST gallery, and Annie Wharton who helped me place paintings in these crazy places and dealt with fees for TV studios who filmed in front of a mural I did… I liked it a lot out there, but I’m glad to be back in New York! I’m closer to Europe and my family here.”In her work, it’s clear Magenheimer has taken on the aesthetic features associated with the natural surroundings, and different models of artistic production from the bohemian scene of musicians and makers in each place. In her most recent series of smaller oils on linen, her palette reflects the surface cheer and vague paranoia of living in an earthquake zone, which is particularly noticeable in “Echo Lake,” and an untitled, vibrating yellow abstraction of stacked crescent moons in vivid purples, greens, and blues. Calligraphic slashes of charcoal and spatterings of graphite and charcoal dust mark out an ideology developing through a variety of channels that take note of current models of process-based abstraction but deny them any real control over her personal, and original modes of mark-making.You can see more of her work on her website: www.andimagenheimer.com, hear the alien ballads of Dusty Mìller at www.soundcloud.com/dustymill, and query at [email protected]/*  */.
