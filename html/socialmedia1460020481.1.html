“The demographic on Snapchat is much different from the demographic that’s reading People right now,” one Time Inc. exec recently told Digiday — and, if you spend much time on People’s channel, that seems pretty obvious. The day after the Grammys, People (median reader age: 41) posted 18 stories; 14 of them prominently featured Taylor Swift. There’s a legit hunger for Bey and Tay, but companies like Buzzfeed have proven there are organic ways to create GIFs without pandering like you’re the Papa Johns Twitter account.On Snapchat, outlets like People and CNN often come off as parents trying to make conversation in the minivan on the way home from soccer practice, trusting SEO metrics like it’s their GPS. Even more puzzling is Snapchat’s partnership with Daily Mail. The British tabloid has more print readers over the age of 65 than under the age of 54, and recently pushed onto Snapchat this dumb story about a UFO that was obviously not a UFO. Also confounding is why, if the guest list is so selective, much of the content is amateurish, as in Tastemade’s “Food Fight: Cupcakes vs. Muffins,” which clarifies that “cupcakes are ultimately miniature versions of whole cakes. They have cake. They have frosting. Hence the name — cupcake.” The Internet is already hip-deep in such bullshit; Snapchat Discover promised quality and didn’t have to add more slop to the trough.A Newsstand Inside a Messaging AppSo how should we make sense of the mishmash of storytelling inside this $16 billion media world darling? Snapchat is not a news app, it’s a messaging app. What’s innovative about Stories isn’t that media outlets get to pander to young readers on yet another platform, it’s the way those outlets are integrating themselves into users’ messages and reshaping the way they socialize. Snapchat’s claim that Discover “is not social media” misses the point. It’s the most social media I’ve ever seen, but in new ways.That National Geographic “You’re a hoot” owl video? It was built for you to send directly to a friend (or group of friends) on Snapchat, maybe with a little personal scribble to turn it into your very own “Snapsterpiece.” You don’t just retweet a story to anonymous followers, or share a link with all your “friends” on Facebook. It’s more intimate than that. The meme becomes your message, like a self-destructing Hallmark card.Alongside G-rated owl jokes, the country’s most august media outlets are producing an experimental, motley mix of fill-in-the-blank cards in the style of O magazine, Mad-Libs-style mood statements, multiple-choice personality quizzes, and a smorgasbord of personalizable GIFs, sponsored geofilters, and which-Kardashian-are-you quizzes: the next-gen, shareable equivalent of schoolyard cootie-catchers and MASH games.Recently, I found what might be the purest shareable Snap: a half-drawn face, with the rest left to be filled in. Here’s the complete text: “Today I feel _______.”Other posts are more labored, like this one from People that tries way too hard: “Dear [name of bff] you are the [celebrity] to my [member of celebrity’s squad], spending time [favorite activity] with you makes me happier than [favorite food]. You will always be my favorite person — at least until [hot dude] finally falls in love with me.”By comparison, Buzzfeed recently posted a single shareable image: a guy sitting on the toilet with his pants down, with the thought bubbles: “listen up if you have time to POOP you have time to text me back.”This is all, admittedly, ridiculous. But if Snapchat Discover says something about the future of media, this is what’s new about it. Most of these shareable images and videos aren’t even watermarked or branded so that recipients will know which company created them. These companies aren’t trying to multiply brand impressions or become the subject of conversation. They’re trying to be the conversation.Media companies have always tried to channel how their readers feel. On Snapchat, they’re following people into their most private, intimate, or goofy messages, framing their conversations with kitten GIFs, Disney princess memes, and poop jokes. It’s absurd and fun, more seamless than media companies’ meme-making forays into Tumblr or Twitter, and it marks a clear shift in the relationship between media and consumers.Media brands once created content that people simply consumed, then they focused on producing content that people shared. Discover feels like an odd laboratory for what comes next, where media companies are experimenting with short-form entertainment, journalism, and what is essentially multimedia stationery: open templates and professional memes for every minute, for every mood.When you care to send the very best on Snapchat, you can still send your own unfiltered message, or you can screengrab a short Discover post, maybe add a filter or scribble a message to tell a friend that this Monday really sucks, or you hate going to the gym, or that you’re trying to channel your inner Beyoncé today. More than ever, it seems, companies are going to have to listen to what their audiences are saying, in order to help them express how they feel. Already, it’s clear on Discover which brands are really connected to young readers, and which are just reading SEO charts.Of course, branding isn’t contained to Discover on Snapchat, as the whole app integrates more advertising to generate revenue. “Live” stories are often sponsored without attribution. Celebrities regularly endorse products. And advertisers have been turning the app’s essential photo-video messaging service into a meme machine with sponsored filters from advertisers. Recently, selfie-taking users have been able to slap Samsung VR visors on their faces, dump virtual Gatorade coolers over their heads, and paste Dunkin Donuts pumpkin-flavored beverages in front of their lips. Largely, these filters are fun novelty gags, but they’re also a new frontier: advertisers’ foray into a core function of the app that was unbranded during the app’s rise to ubiquity.I keep thinking of that old poem, “America,” by Allen Ginsberg:I’m addressing you.Are you going to let our emotional life be run by Time Magazine?I’m obsessed by Time Magazine.I read it every week.Will young users let their emotional lives be filtered through brands on Snapchat? Do they feel like these brands belong in their private conversations? That they’re just silly fun? Or will the app’s users begin to feel like these brands — media companies included — are being too pushy?I have no idea. But since every third story on Discover mentions Taylor Swift, I’ll conclude by quoting her song “We Know Places.” They are the hunters, we are the foxes… And we run. Just about every youth-driven company eventually takes it too far, and when the vibe is off, as Tay sings, young people run for the fences— and onto the next new thing.After all, that’s how they found Snapchat.
