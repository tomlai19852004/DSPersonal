Most Sexuality Teachers Know What Good Sex Ed IsWe just aren’t allowed to teach it.I am your average middle- and high-school sex-ed teacher, with the exception that I am lucky enough to teach at an independent Quaker school. I am able to give my students an education in sexuality that is much different than what I received as a public school kid in the 1990s. Without the constraints placed on many other teachers, I am permitted to express a definition of sexuality that aligns with my school’s Quaker values. Human sexuality is innate from birth to death. It is important and beautiful, and we are incredibly lucky to have it.When lesson planning, I regularly turn to the leaders of comprehensive sexuality education for inspiration—organizations like the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) and the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and educators like Deborah Roffman and Al Vernacchio. My curriculum is based on the work of these folks and the researchers that have proved that “abstinence only, just don’t do it” sex ed fails young people in so many ways.My institution and students’ parents encourage me to provide an opportunity for students to explore all sorts of topics fundamentally based in equality and good science. Here is just a sample of what I am free to cover:The beautiful intricacies of our reproductive systems, whether they are male, female, or intersexThe physiology of the sexual response cycle and arousalSexual identity as a continuum including biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientationThe varying definitions of “family”Body image and media literacyCrushes, dating, relationships, love, and emotional intimacyPhysical intimacy, sexual activity, masturbation (and not in the “you will grow hair on your palms” kind of way), and pornographyDisease risk, condoms, contraception, unintended pregnancy options, and reproductive health careExpressing and asking for consent, sexual harassment, abuse, and rapeAnd perhaps most important, communicating our needs and feelings to another personMy most important job is to artfully answer their questions — all of them. Even the ones about the stuff that may only exist in the Urban Dictionary.As a teacher, I am also blessed with the gift of time. At my school, formal sexuality education is mandatory in fifth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth grades. It is exceedingly more than many schools offer, but it still feels like it is not nearly enough to give every young person what they need.Why isn’t every sexuality teacher able to offer comprehensive sexuality education like this? The answer is simple: They are not allowed to because of outdated and even discriminatory state laws.Here is the current sexuality education law in Pennsylvania:Schools in Pennsylvania are not required to teach sexuality education… however, require primary, intermediate, middle, and high schools to teach sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV education; though primary schools are allowed to omit instruction on the sexual methods of disease transmission. Schools must use materials that have been determined by the local school district, are age-appropriate, discuss prevention, and stress abstinence as “the only completely reliable means of preventing sexual transmission.”As an example from the other side country, here is Arizona’s law:Arizona law does not require schools to teach sexuality education or sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV education… if a school chooses to teach these topics, instruction must be age-appropriate and must stress abstinence. Further, if a school chooses to teach HIV education, such instruction must be medically accurate but cannot promote a “homosexual lifestyle,” portray “homosexuality as a positive alternative lifestyle,” or “suggest that some methods of sex are safe methods of homosexual sex.”You can find the full report on state laws here.Many sexuality teachers are forced to operate in a system where a minority of parents, organizations, and lawmakers who oppose comprehensive sexuality education are allowed to suppress proven research in developing curriculum, resulting in the health and safety of young people’s lives being jeopardized. We live in a country where school board meetings on sex-ed curriculum end in chaos, Planned Parenthood funding is intensely political, and as a nation, we can’t seem to come anywhere close to cultural agreement on whether sex is cool, shameful, or somewhere in between.Sexual knowledge is power, and we are robbing young people of power over their own lives every day.The answer to quality and effective sexuality education is out there, along with the sexuality educators who are equipped to teach it. What we need most are advocates. We need parents, fellow teachers, health care providers, lawmakers, and other community members telling schools that are kids need more then “sex ed.” They need sexuality education.
