Architecture as Social Media 01A provocation: It was not so long ago according to my memory, but perhaps a very long time ago in yours, that the architectural historian Kenneth Frampton expressed his despair at the impact of grainy black and white photographs and photo-lithography on architecture. For him, a loss of detail, clarity, material quality and depth of field in actual buildings came with the associated dilemma that as more architecture from more diverse locations was published, the photograph effectively became a substitute for lived experience, more than a supplement, perhaps worse, a problematic, surrogate architecture itself, distanced from reality. Time passes. It is arguable that three and half decades of high gloss, large format publications exacerbate this distancing effect. On the pages of the AR, A+U, GA, Quaderns, or El Croquis, atmospheric particularity, tectonic veracity and perspectival intricacy dissipate with every new image. Paradoxically, as the number of documented buildings increases, entire categories of architectural knowledge vanish, in tandem with more than a hint of what the science fiction writer J.G Ballard ominously called the ‘death of affect’.Now, in social media, taking on late twentieth century end of times pessimism and early twenty-first century millennial hubris equally, digital photographs or videos, easy to take and easy to make, have become vehicles, the obligatory transport for a status update. But, for thousands of Facebook friends or Instagram followers, Pinterest, Tumblr, Snapchat or Google+ users, only the hottest images survive the scroll through. Architecture’s hotties hold out longer when interest typically fades with algorithmic precision after forty-eight hours. When even the coolest buildings are compelled to deliver ‘like’-able imagery, we might be witnessing the flip-side of Frampton’s provocation, too many images, and too much mega-pixel high-definition heat, producing another kind of distance…Or not? … Perhaps a new closeness, an intimacy, is being constructed, a more affecting, desirable condition; indeed, more desire, generally — satisfaction, guaranteed? Anyway, how do we account for the emergence of ‘made for Instagram’ moments, or ‘selfie spots’ as a prerequisite? And, what should we make of the evident popularity of crowd-sourced category rehabilitation and the excitement associated with discovery and collection. Encyclopedic revivalism can be intoxicating, as lost gems are recuperated and appropriated, copies of copies circulate, traveling at the speed of light. While it might be more or less clear what social media is doing for Architects, what is it doing for or to architecture?How is the ‘social’ assembled in or by social media, and at The Cooper Union in NYC, a school that has an explicit ‘social contract’ how could we understand this ‘mediated social’ in relation to architecture?
