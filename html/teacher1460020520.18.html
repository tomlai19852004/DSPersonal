“Need Is a Very Good Teacher”I’m not a hugger.If, at the end of an interview, I’ve hit it off especially well with a subject, I’ll relent and come in for a quick one. In all my years of reporting, only one person, a Brazilian woman named Dagmar Garroux, has ever begun our time together with a hug.Thirty seconds after I walk into Casa do Zezinho, the educational center she founded two decades ago in the Brazilian favela of Parque Santo Antonio, she reaches up and pulls me in. “You will not forget me!” she says. She chortles, and as she lets go, her eyes dance like sparkling dark gemstones on the weathered landscape of her face.Garroux has always been a teacher by aspiration, if not by temperament. Stubborn and vocal, impatient and often exasperated, “I was never able to find a job teaching in a formal school,” she says. In the mid-1970s, she instead found herself with a bunch of rich people’s problems. Specifically, they were rich people’s problem children: the scions of high-status, politically out-of-favor families pushed into Brazil by coups d’etat and biding their well-to-do time until the next tranche of coups returned them to power, glory, and favor. “They were exiled from Chile, from Argentina, from Colombia. All of South America had dictatorships! And they were,” she says, drawing out a favorite story in the gravel of her voice, “children with behavioral problems.”“I was always trying to think of a different form of education,” Garroux says. And for these different kinds of students, for these young people dealing with the trauma of being ejected from their homelands with shades of rebellion from insolence to imperiousness, she devised a different kind of lesson—not talking or listening or soothing or coddling. She took them to the slums. “I would say: Look! These are people who have been traumatized. But they have been traumatized for 450 years. They have been totally abandoned. They have no education. They have no health care. They have no sewage system. They are there, and they are surviving. Your trauma? Your trauma is temporary.”It’s not a lesson plan that would be approved by many, if any, American educators: You thought your life sucked? Well, these people’s lives suck more! It’s unclear whether it even worked for the rich kids—Garroux waves the question away—and they eventually trickled back to their native countries anyway. She, though, had found her mission and passion. In Parque Santo Antonio, she discovered kids who needed someone—who needed her. She offered some of them a bed and a refuge in her home—“I had only one son,” she says simply.In some cases, this woman, who barely breaches 5 feet, gave them protection. She tells the story of one “simple” boy “with mental problems” who was being used by neighborhood drug runners as a gofer. “I went to talk to the big drug dealer,” she says, “and I said, ‘Where are your ethics? This boy has mental problems! He can count to 1, and 2, more or less, but 3 is too much. That is the only mathematical thinking he can do!’” They let her have him.Garroux has thousands more stories like that one—one for each of the young people who have come through Casa do Zezinho, an oasis of laughter and learning in Parque Santo Antonio, a corner of Sao Paulo once so neglected and crime-ridden that, in the past, it has been being singled out by the U.N. to stand for what needs fixing—a poor-place poster child.The infamy of its deprivation has been, at times, useful for publicity and fundraising. Casa do Zezinho runs entirely on grants and donations. “I am an entrepreneur and a businesswoman,” Garroux says with a sigh. She points at a picture of a dragon that decorates one wall. “You know I am part-Mongolian? I am also part-Silician. And everyone in our family does illegal things. Thank goodness I went to the good side.” Call her a shakedown artist, a professional beggar of the highest caliber—she scrapes together the thousands that it takes to run the place each year, though she wishes she had space to take all the kids who want to come. “I manage to manage. Managing with money? Anyone can do that. But managing in poverty—need is a very good teacher. It gives you creativity.”After another hug, she sends me on a tour of the school, a brightly decorated warren of rooms packed with hundreds and hundreds of children. Sixty percent of the staff were once students themselves, and to a person, they gush with affection for the woman they know as Tia Dag—Auntie Dag. It is she, they say, who decided that there should be a mosaic workshop. It is she who strong-armed corporations to donate old PCs for the computer lab. It is she who thought to kit out a full-scale professional kitchen—a place to train some of the older kids in the culinary arts. It is she who said, Why shouldn’t some of the older kids publish a monthly magazine?In one classroom, I meet Victor Henrique, a whirlygig of a nine-year-old who shows off his paintings and shyly relates that he has been nicknamed “Britto 2.” His work explodes with awesome color, and he giggles bashfully when I say that I’d hang it on my apartment walls. I tell him: It’s true, that I love what he’s done. And I think: How phenomenal that he and his classmates even know who Romero Britto is.As I wander Casa do Zezinho, an afternoon thunderstorm unleashes a torrent of rain that slams against the metal roofs. Unlike the plywood constructions that are typical of much of the rest of the neighborhood, the school’s walls are solid and stolid. The fetid, green-gray stream that runs through Parque Santo Antonio often floods in storms like this, but this school is on higher ground. It’s safe.I think of the mosaic I saw on one classroom door, created by students in a workshop at the center: “Direito ao sonho”—the right to dream. Then I spot Garroux, who is standing, beaming, amid a crowd of kids. She’s giving them hugs. She’s giving them hope.
