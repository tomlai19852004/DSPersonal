The way elBulli experiments with ingredients is what inspires us to question and verify each component. We hope our designers can create beautiful experiences within Spotify through our Design Principles and Guidelines, just as elBulli creates delicious experiences through the recipes from their experiments.With Glue we believe it’s very important to express the brand in our products. So is the need for our design language to evolve responsively and adapt gracefully in function of changing behaviours, new platforms and new standards.
