Everyone recognizes Boston as one of America’s oldest, and therefore most traditional, cities. Its streets are characterized by the traditional New England stone- and brick-based architectural style, providing it with a classic, old-school energy. It may seem that, because of its appearance, Boston hopelessly lacks a sense of architectural innovation. That couldn’t be more incorrect.Consider this: boasting 250,000 college students within an overall population of 650,000, Boston has one of the country’s most youthful populations. These students bring a modern edge to our old city, especially those engaged in the art world. Boston contains strong programs in art, music, performing arts, and, most notably, architecture. Here, we give you a rundown of the city’s most prestigious undergraduate architecture programs.Boston UniversityImage sourceBU’s architecture program not only focuses on preparing students for careers and graduate studies in architecture, but it also focuses on architecture’s historical and social relevance by encouraging students to take related courses such as archaeology, classics, philosophy and literature. Each student works closely with an advisor to construct the most meaningful individual curriculum suited to his or her interests. Furthermore, BU has a relationship with the Courtauld Institute of Art at University of London, where students have the opportunity to take courses during their study abroad.Boston Architectural CollegeImage sourceThe BAC is the largest private college of spatial design in New England. It provides both Bachelor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs that provide students with equal parts hands-on practice and academic studies. Critical thinking and problem solving are absolutely necessary to successful architectural design at BAC. There is a strong emphasis on actual experience, where students have the opportunity to collaborate and make a positive impact on their community. The undergraduate Bachelor of Architecture program is six years long in order to provide its students the most thorough education possible.Massachusetts College of Art and DesignImage sourceAt MassArt, classes in the four-year architecture program are taught by practicing professionals and field trips are frequent in order to give students as much real-world experience as possible. Architecture at MassArt prioritizes client needs and creating designs that are sensitive to the environment. Students now have the option to receive a master of architecture degree with an additional four semesters of courses.Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyImage sourceArchitecture was one of the four core original departments at this world-renowned university when it was founded in 1861, meaning the program has only gotten stronger in the past 150 or so years. There are five discipline groups within the major: Architectural Design; Building Technology; Computation, Art, Culture, and Technology; and History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture. Responsible, efficient, and creative design is emphasized, and the in-depth nature of the department ensures that its students have knowledge transferrable to the working world.Northeastern UniversityImage sourceNortheastern’s School of Architecture is within the College of Arts, Media, and Design. The school has a curriculum that incorporates both technical and problem-solving skills to help its students fulfill its mission “to engage the challenges of the contemporary city.” Like the rest of undergraduate programs, the School of Architecture is a five-year program that requires co-op employment and study-abroad semesters, giving students real work experience in their field of study prior to graduation.Wellesley CollegeImage sourceWellesley architecture is an interdepartmental major, combining architectural history with studio practice. Students have the ability to take courses in art, math, and physics, which allows them to garner a general appreciation for architecture and all of its facets. Those majoring in the subject may focus on architectural history, studio investigation, or a balance of both. Since Wellesley students have the ability to cross-register at MIT, those within the major have the opportunity to take advantage of MIT’s prestigious architecture studios and courses.Wentworth Institute of TechnologyImage sourceWIT’s pre-professional 8-semester program is broken into two chunks: a broad introduction for the first three semesters and more in-depth, complex courses for the remaining five. Three concentrations are offered for students to pursue after the first semester of their sophomore year. The first is “Adaptive Interventions”, which focuses on sustainability, regenerative urbanism, and related strategies. Second is “Emerging Technologies”, which focuses on material, craft, and role of technology in architecture. Last is “Urbanism”, which focuses on the influence of art, literature, economics, and politics on design.Like what you see? Join our mailing list!
