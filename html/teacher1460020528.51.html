REGAN: We choose to do the “hard” work. Each day, on many things where it would be easier just to work on some things or make quick decisions on our own, we choose to do it together. This sometimes can take more time, slow things down (for the better, usually, I would add), or be frustrating. But we do it and we listen to each other, we watch and we learn from each other. Many people collaborate, but in our office, our desks face each other, we share materials that cover our desks, we have dual monitors that we can connect our laptops to and that rotate so that we can show each other what we are doing and thinking about.John and I are together the entire school day — we do not separate our content, we do not separate our days, or even parts of the day. We meet with our student design teams together, we work together to speak the same language with our kids and be on the same page.We committed to the belief that truly collaborating and teaching in an interdisciplinary way meant being in the same room, with the same students, at the same time, all the time. In doing this, we stretch ourselves and learn new things daily from each other about interacting with students — advice, expertise, decisions, influences, etc. Yes, this is harder, but it pays off big. We’ve had to force ourselves to stay true to this, but seeing the results encourages the process and it is easier now.“We’ve had to force ourselves to stay true to this, but seeing the results encourages the process and it is easier now.” -ReganJOHN: Behind all of the work that we do together is a deep belief that we are not out doing things “to” students, but doing things with students, and our collaboration shows this.We have never really talked about this, but I think what drives us is that if we are going to ask students to radically collaborate then we better be radically collaborating ourselves.It is difficult. It would be much easier for us to just separate the students and each take half of them and do our own thing. But we don’t get the best of us as teachers that way. I think your explanation of our desks is a great analogy for what we do every single day. We look and listen at and to each other, and while it is difficult, it is work worth doing, and ultimately it is really quite fun.“We look and listen at and to each other, and while it is difficult, it is work worth doing, and ultimately it is really quite fun.” — JohnI think that this idea of fun is worth talking about as well. We do a lot of playing at work, and sometimes we don’t always know why we are doing something. Which is weird in an outcome based education world, but some of our best results have come with just giving kids interesting things to play with, and seeing what happens.We bring an interesting article, toy, plant, art supply to the table and say, “I wonder what would happen if…” and then we just do it. But the most important part of this is that we radically collaborate during and after this and talk about what worked and what didn’t work in a very organic way.Our team meetings together with the student teams have been one of the most effective things that we have done. I initially wanted to do those individually by splitting up the students, if you remember. I was wrong. Those conversations that we have had with the student teams, and the “record keeping” we do while we talk with them has really paid off. I have learned so much about teaching and learning by listening to you in those meetings, and the students get to hear how competent design thinkers go about processing design thinking.Connect with Regan and John on The Teachers Guild.
