How To Be A Successful Artistwww.artisttree.ioBeing an artist, in one form or another, is a dream that most of us have at some point in our lives. When I was 6 I can remember my love for painting and creating what I thought were masterpieces, by dunking my hands into a paint pot and then proceeding to follow Mr Miyagi’s technique of ‘wax on, wax off’. If you have no idea who Mr. Miyagi is or what his technique is, watch Karate Kid!Why is it that so many artists struggle to achieve success and what differentiates successful artists from unsuccessful artists?Firstly, what do we mean by success? Some people, myself included, consider just completing a drawing or a painting a success. Some artists may regard selling a painting a success, and for others making $1000's of dollars is their idea of success. Having a clear understanding of what you define as success governs any feeling of achievement throughout an artist’s career; whether that is commercial success, critical success or just getting your art out there.Furthermore, passion cannot be underrated. If you live, breathe and sleep art it will help you maintain your energy levels when times get tough. The life of an artist is not an easy care-free life but if you love your work you will have the drive to push on and breakdown the barriers getting in your way.“Do it with passion, or not at all!”The hardest skill to hone, in my personal experience, is single-mindedness or focus. When you first set out on your journey to become a successful artist you must be focused on your work and consistently creating time to work on your art. Sacrifices are needed to become a success. Art needs to take priority over your social life, relaxing on the beach and seeing your family. If you are single-minded and focused on your art and ready to sacrifice these aspects of your life, you have dealt with one of the toughest obstacles to success.Although talent is a major factor in an artist’s ability to complete and sell their work, I feel that talent is an outcome of hard work. So an artist’s inbuilt creative ability is important but their hard work and persistence is more vital. This hard work and persistence instils a mindset of constantly improving and working on various aspects of oneself as an artist and entrepreneur.I say entrepreneur because having an entrepreneurial spirit and business know-how can be a massive game-changer for an underachieving artist. If an artist is somewhat of an ‘artpreneur’, this can make the artist’s life a whole lot easier. They will have a great understanding and ability to develop key partnerships, get their artwork promoted and seen by the greater public and monetize their creative pieces much more efficiently.“While there is not one perfect formula that will work for every artist, there are certain pathways that foster consistently positive outcomes.”
