On his aspirations for the firm in the next 5–10 yearsI am choosier about the work that we take on and hopefully inviting like-minded clients. Being a small firm practitioner, attracting people that share a similar set of values and a parallel vision in a small city is quite challenging. I’d be content to continue bringing new life to the commercial building stock in my region and leave a mark of our time. However, in order to do relevant contemporary residential work, we will need to draw from a larger area. This is beginning to happen with the internet and forms of social media. A steady diet of the same thing gets tiresome and makes me afraid of becoming stale or irrelevant.This post was previously published on blog.modelo.io on 11/6/15.
