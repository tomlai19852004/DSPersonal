Few would argue that providing black and brown students with similarly hued teachers is sufficient to close achievement gaps. Certainly, a teacher’s effectiveness matters far more than his or her racial identity. But racial interactions do shape student performance: Some studies have shown a bump in student achievement for students who are taught by teachers of the same race. Additionally, teachers of color serve as valuable models of professional success and academic achievement for the students of color in their classrooms. Closing the diversity gap between students of color and teachers who look like them can indeed contribute to closing the achievement gap between those students and their white peers.It’s no accident that Jennings became a teacher. Her decision to enter the teaching profession was driven not just by her own passion, but also by BPS’ “grow-your-own” approach to recruiting promising prospective teachers of color — while they are still in high school. Jennings joined Teach Boston during her junior year, along with a cohort of her classmates. She worked as a teaching assistant in the summer before 12th grade, lived on campus, and took academic coursework through Wheelock College, where she eventually enrolled for her undergraduate degree.Ceronne Daly, Director of Diversity Programs for BPS, oversees the program that originally sparked Jennings’ interest in teaching — and also served as Jennings’ mentor. “The program really helped Ava to realize that she wanted to be a teacher,” said Daly. “There are a lot of people who are good with kids who end up working at the Y.”Programs like this harness high school students’ passion for working with children and channel it into a desire to teach. These programs also provide concrete development opportunities, mentorship, and early exposure to a university setting.While this program is a promising start, Daly is concerned that there are still too many barriers preventing these students from persisting through college and on to graduation and certification. “The transition from high school to college needs to be more intentional,” she explained, “by meeting the students when they get there and creating cohorts that will advance together.” Students of color are more likely to be the first in their family to attend college and may require additional support to navigate the challenges of the unfamiliar university setting.According to Jennings, once in college, many of her classmates of color struggled with the coursework. Without the support they needed, some opted for less rigorous degree programs and others dropped out entirely. After graduation, Massachusetts licensure exams — some of the most rigorous in the country — proved to be yet another barrier. Some students, like Jennings, managed to overcome the systemic failures in the fragmented pipeline — but they were the exception, not the rule.This dynamic is not unique. Around the country, schools of education are not graduating diverse cohorts of prospective teachers. Without increasing the overall pool of teacher candidates of color and properly supporting them, districts will be left to compete for the precious few with other districts that need them just as badly.As districts look to increase workforce diversity through recruitment, stronger and more contiguous pipelines offer a more promising and sustainable solution. To make these programs successful at a large-enough scale to move the needle on teacher diversity will take close coordination between districts, universities, and state licensure agencies, with a common goal of establishing a robust pipeline that leads from urban schools into colleges and, ultimately, back to the schools.According to Daly, in order to make this possible “we need to work in a much more connected and concerted way, recognizing that the unit we are working with is a student passing through all these stages.”We also must not reduce the discussion of diversity down to mere racial proportionality between teachers and students. While Jennings believes that a shared racial identity helps teachers build relationships with their students of color, she also believes that shared experience matters more. “It’s one thing to be African-American but also come from the suburbs or a middle-class background,” she said. “It’s another thing when [a teacher] grew up in the same neighborhood as her students.”As districts, we need to update and broaden our definition of “diversity” to truly reflect the complexity of our students’ identities — including race, culture, language, gender, sexual orientation, and the nuances of personal experience.Perhaps most important is cultivating and supporting a culture — among all teachers — of empathy, awareness, authenticity, and commitment to each student as an individual. Jennings encourages her colleagues to get to know each child individually.“Step back, ask questions, and don’t think that you understand your students,” she said. “It’s hard. You still will never truly understand what it’s like to be an African-American kid growing up in Dorchester, or grow up in public housing, or grow up without a father. You can still care a lot. But you won’t ever truly understand.”Ultimately, we need to recognize that while students’ racial identities define much of their experiences, they also have many other identities that we must attend to. Putting black teachers in front of black students or Hispanic teachers in front of Hispanic students won’t necessarily solve this problem. Putting culturally competent teachers in front of culturally complex students will.Illustrations by Marina Munn
