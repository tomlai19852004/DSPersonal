For many people, health issues occupy a huge amount of time, energy and psychic space. Patients with complicated health histories get road-weary as they recount them over and over to doctors. And sadly, doctors from whom a patient seeks help are not immune to tuning out when the history begins to read like an epic war story. But Dr. Reid, Hadley’s neurologist in Missoula, never stopped believing Hadley was suffering from an organic disease. After the Mayo, at their next appointment, she surprised Hadley by having her perform the same neurological drill I was put through by the general neurologist. She noticed Hadley’s dragging gait, how she didn’t swing her right arm when she walked, and felt the telltale Parkinson’s cogwheel rigidity when manipulating Hadley’s arm.“Hadley,” Dr. Reid said, “I think we’ve been going about this the wrong way. Maybe you have Parkinson’s disease.”Hadley was shocked — she was so young! Like me, she thought Parkinson’s was a disease for older people, like her stepfather, Charlie, who’d just been diagnosed the year before. She was prescribed levodopa to take for a week, as I had been. Right away, the levodopa significantly boosted her energy, a change that confirmed she was dopamine deficient and suggested she might be dealing with Parkinson’s.Because there was not a single movement disorders specialist in Montana, Dr. Reid referred Hadley to an MDS in a neighboring state. At first, because Hadley was so young, the MDS, Dr. Youngman, suspected Hadley had Munchausen Syndrome, a serious psychological disorder in which a patient pretends to be sick or injured to get attention. (Fortunately, he didn’t tell her about this concern until over a year later.) After examining her though, Dr. Youngman seemed to easily confirm Dr. Reid’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s.Hadley remembers crying in her car after the appointment, both because in her words, “I felt Parkinson’s was the true answer,” and because she didn’t know how to break the news to her mother, who was still adjusting to Charlie’s PD diagnosis. Hadley’s family members were distressed but supportive, and relieved that her years of searching were over.For Hadley, the diagnosis marked a new start: she no longer would be preoccupied with what was ailing her or spinning with self-doubt about the validity of her illness. Instead of facing a life-threatening condition that could prevent her from seeing Sarah grow up, she saw her life stretching out before her, however imperfectly. At last, she could direct her energy outward with a sense of purpose as a mother, wife, daughter, friend and artist.Continue to Episode Six: “Fight or Flight”For updates, you can follow Catherine on Facebook orcheck her website.Catherine Armsden’s debut novel Dream House is available on Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, andIndiebound.Previous EpisodesEpisode One: “An Illness’s Introduction”Episode Two: “Nothing Serious”Episode Three: “Not The Worst Thing”Episode Four: “A Heart is Opened”
