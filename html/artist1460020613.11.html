Still the question is: what can big labels do for artist who have already created/found there niche audience? If an artist have already done the work of a label; what is a label going to do differently to expand that artist fan base? I feel the big thing missing is artist development, but are big labels doing that anymore? It seems like they just want to give an artist a 360 deal and ride the coat tails of what that artist has already created. As a fan of music; I care about the success of an artist not the record label! Nor do I care about awards! What I care about is the music, the feeling, and the realness/transparency of an artist!
