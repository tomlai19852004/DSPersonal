Artistic Skill, Does it Kill or Does it Cure?The image of mentally tortured artist might seem like a lot stereotypical. There are no shortage of example that creative people suffer from self destruction and mental illness.Ernest Hemingway, a famous American author, may suffered from bipolar and certain other personality disorder. His writings put him into winning Nobel Prize in Literature and Pulitzer Prize in fiction proved him as a successful writer.Hemingway, which are now considered changing the nature of American literature, such as For Whom The Bell Tolls (1940) and The Old Man And The Sea (1952), drown into alcoholism and several health problem and later on shot himself with his twelve-gauge shotgun in 1961.Writers and creative people across all genres, seems to have this reputation for being potential mentally unstable.In a lot of cases, here’s why:To make a piece, writer should be able to empathize and penetrate within the character. And this emotional creative process can leads to a lot of emotional risks as the pressure of making good piece is high.Elizabeth Gilbert , the author who famous for her book, “Eat, Pray, Love” on her famous TED talk Your Elusive Creative Genius stated that:“We’ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.”Creative process drains people. Creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked. We somehow have this heavy anxiety throughout creating an artistic piece. Thought the inspiration might slips off if it’s not on the right moment, or it didn’t turn up into brilliant masterpiece. But how to control that?Writers should start build a protective psychological construct that can separate us, from our creative piece. From there, we can make a defense system that separate us and our writer persona. So whether you fail or fly, it wont matter. You’ll live. Happily.Or Does it Cure?What if creativity can actually exhaling your bad mojo? What if writing can actually cures depression? There are studies stated that writing a journal can improve your mental health. So why don’t we make those creative process ‘healthier’? Tests also proven that creative expression releases dopamine, a brain chemical associated with pleasure.If we wanna look it this way:To create art, a person could let out powerful emotions that have been internalized. That means your inner burden can be lifted as you pour your emotions to your vessel. Show up, Do your art, be jolly.
