JH: Your team members very much appreciate your management style and working with you.LE: That’s really nice to hear. I’m seeing many people whom I’ve worked with in the past 15 years growing and learning, and taking on responsibilities. In my mind, that shows they are doing exactly what we think they should do — and what, I hope, I’ve helped them to do.JH: Do you feel you are still growing? What inspires you?LE: Yes, I absolutely feel like I am still growing. I’m the kind of person who is very lucky to wake up every morning feeling positive, even if the prior day was not great. I’m definitely an eternal optimist.Enjoying your job is really important. It’s great for you and great for the people around you. In the end, even our clients and consultants are happier if they enjoy what they are doing. We’re all more successful.
