Why Our Teachers Need To Be ActivistsThe other day, I heard a story about one of the teachers in my school that repulsed me. A friend of mine was sitting in study hall close to a student, an Asian junior with a speech impediment, who was studying with friends. For the record, going to a different study hall during a free period, lunch, or other study hall is allowed in my school When the half-period bell rang, he got up to go back to his study hall. As he started to leave, the teacher asked him, “What are you doing here?” The student tried to respond with humor by saying something like “This isn’t biology?” The teacher responded with saying, “I can’t understand what you’re saying.” The student tried to repeat what he said, but the teacher kept interrupting with how she couldn’t understand him. She eventually got fed up with trying to understand him, and ordered him to leave her classroom. When he left, she said to her class, “Was he even speaking English?”This is not okay. THIS IS NOT OKAY. Regardless of whether or not this teacher gets punished, it shouldn’t have happened in the first place. This is a perfect example of the absolute necessity of teaching acceptance to teachers.This is also not a one time thing. I’ve seen teachers directly discriminate against people many times. It’s the 21st century. We need to put an end to discrimination in the classroom.This can come in many forms, and every time it happens, it discourages the student discriminated against. It can be anything from teachers mainly calling on males in class to a teacher calling a non-cisgender student by the incorrect pronouns. And though clearly it doesn’t happen with every teacher, it happens with too many.I propose we don’t do this just by telling teachers to not be racist or sexist or homophobic or what have you — I think our teachers should be activists.For example, we should teach our teachers to be feminists. Why? Feminism makes you aware of any time you are being even remotely sexist. It will make our gym teachers aware of how it’s not okay that they only call on guys in class. It will make our health teachers aware of how they talk about women doing all of the cooking for the family. It will make our computer teachers aware of when they incorrectly refer to all coders and founders with male pronouns. It will encourage female students to be more engaged in class.This is just one example — we need our teachers to be actively aware of the discrimination. They are the ones who set examples. If the teachers in our elementary schools always ask “big strong boys” to carry heavy things, then this behavior will transfer to the students, and subconsciously stay with them their entire lives. If our teachers ask Asian students if they’re even speaking English, the kids will make fun of them for the same thing.We have an obligation to our students to make our teachers activists.
