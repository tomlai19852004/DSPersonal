It’s not clear if TpT is changing anyone’s teaching, or if it even needs to. But it feels like TpT has answered some kind of simmering call, tapping into something bigger than task cards and cute fonts. Something that over the past decade—with the rise of No Child Left Behind [NCLB] and Common Core, test scores linked to job security, shrinking budgets, and increasing demands made on America’s teachers—has become deeply ingrained into the educator zeitgeist: a teacher’s need for recognition for the time and energy they put into their students. And that recognition seems most significant when it comes from fellow educators.Being successful on TpT demands even more time from teachers in their already demanding schedules. The five TpT teachers interviewed for this story said that, on average, each piece of material (whether an actual lesson, task card or interactive notebook) requires between 40 and 60 hours to create, a figure Freed backed up. Then there’s all the marketing: keeping up multiple social media profiles to market their store, doing bookkeeping, coming up with ideas for new materials, and responding to teachers who have questions or need extra help teaching the materials they purchased online. Yet each maintained that the hard work was worth it, and that other educators aren’t interested in fancy marketing materials but are looking for quality, Common Core–aligned material they can rely on.Four of the five teachers interviewed for this story have left the classroom in the past year to focus solely on their TpT stores. Each have their own reasons, of course. Two middle-school science teachers in Atlanta, Melissa Zaher and Gretchen Vikingson, are thrilled to run their TpT store, Getting Nerdy with Mel and Gerdy, from home so they can be with their young children. Blair Turner left because TpT helped her discover what she feels is her real talent, curriculum design. And then there’s ping-ponging teacher Karen Jones, who hasn’t decided if she’ll return to her job, if it’s even offered to her, next spring.Jones didn’t feel comfortable revealing how much income she’s making from her TpT store, only saying that 2015 was her biggest year yet and swearing not even her family knows how much she’s making. But she does say it was enough to help buy a home in a beautiful suburb with nice public schools that provide great therapies for one of her children, who has special needs.“I have to be honest and tell you that I do get a little nervous about putting [financial] numbers out there without explanation. [My lessons] are not just cute clipart, but knowing and understanding child development and how to engage young students enough to teach them a vital skill such as reading,” Jones said. “It’s not easy.”Bright is made possible by funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
