Why Do Teachers Quit?Why do teachers quit teaching? And why are so many of those who do seen as the best by both their colleagues and their students? It’s a complicated phenomenon, but it carries a lot of social urgency. If the teaching profession doesn’t grow by bringing in and maintaining talent and their commitment, the future is in real trouble. And, apparently, it is.We’re tempted to see the question of why teachers quit as simply the inverse of why teachers start to teach in the first place. Opportunity, motivation, skills use, etc. Fix the incentives, and the crisis is solved.But behavioral equilibria aren’t always symmetrical. Like a lobster trap, some behaviors are easy to enter into, much harder to exit from. Drug addiction comes to mind. Others may be very hard to enter and/or sustain yet easy to exit — for example, championship-level athletics. Structural and environmental factors interact with individual perceptions in complex ways. Like any behavioral commitment, the decision to either enter into a teaching relationship or leave it involves balancing perceptions of costs and benefits. But calculating that balance is chaotic.Entering into teaching entails a certain fundamental arrogance, or at least an assumption of superiority of sorts. The teacher must believe that s/he is in possession of more or better information than are the students, or perhaps of more or better analytical tools or ways of approaching the topic. This doesn’t imply that the teacher is in some existential way better than the students; only that with regard to the particular topic at hand s/he believes that s/he has some advantage that s/he would like to share with the students. This is easy to formulate and justify in the case of pre-schoolers; not always so clear when teaching adults, particularly practicing professionals.Teaching requires interpersonal engagement, although it may vary from intense to limited. Individuals must be convinced that investing their energy in that engagement is worthwhile, in terms of some multiple combination of material and hedonic (intangible) rewards. Partly, we teach because we can use our superiority in information and/or information processing skills as a source of return; i.e., we get paid to do so because others want what we have. Partly, we teach because we believe that sharing our superior understanding will make other people and the world around us better. And partly, we teach because demonstrating our superiority feeds our ego. It’s not necessary to attach any particular moral merit or demerit to a particular motive to acknowledge that the act of teaching (whatever that might involve) is fueled by complex and constantly shifting incentives.The motives behind students’ engagement and that of their instructor may not align well. Students always bring their own information and information processing skills to engage those being shared by the instructor. Students may well believe that the instructor’s ideas are of dubious relevance considering what they already know; they may or may not be correct. The same can be said of information processing tools such as analytical approaches or frames.Since information≡power, teaching/learning relationships inevitably involve power exchanges of one form or another. The opportunity to exercise power of one sort or another is a powerful incentive for some people. But those eager to exercise power over others are not always equally comfortable submitting to the exercise of power over them. Power equilibria are inherently unstable.Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics dealing particularly with functions whose inputs may vary continuously but whose outputs may suddenly and unpredictably shift from one extreme value to another. At least metaphorically, teaching can be evaluated in these terms. Basically, teachers quit teaching when they perceive that the costs of staying in the relationship exceed the benefits received. But since both costs and benefits consist of complex and shifting elements varying enormously across individuals and situations, the calculus is chaotic. Just when our own chaos model of incentives might flip in value from “teach” to “not teach” or back again isn’t predictable even to ourselves, let alone anyone else. Very small changes in inputs can result in dramatically different outcomes.The situation is more complicated, of course — teaching isn’t simply an on/off switch but more of a rheostat. It’s possible to remain nominally a teacher and yet effectively withdraw from actually doing anything. We all know teachers who just “phone it in”. It’s frequently the case that we can be great teachers for some students while being disastrous for others. And sometimes even if we withdraw from any formal teaching roles, we still have the urge to share our ideas and information — to remain intellectually engaged with the growth of others. Sometimes that leads us to blog.And just to multiply the complexity, teaching usually is carried out in the context of an organization of some sort, with all that that entails. As Albert Hirschman described many years ago, entry and exit into organizations is usually mediated by the phenomena of voice — our ability to shape the organization to our own desires and purposes — and loyalty — our sense of obligation to the institution itself. A simple idea, although as some colleagues and I found out when we tried to apply this idea to faculty behavior, its interpretations quickly become chaotic as well.In general, organizations are much better at creating obstacles and disincentives than they are at motivating behavior — a topic worth exploring in its own right at some point! The “dead hand of bureaucracy” is frequently cited as one source of the problem by many departing teachers. It’s clear that educational institutions don’t always or even often give the kind of support and encouragement to good teachers that they ought to provide.I don’t have an answer here. To the degree there is one (or many), they probably involve significant restructuring of both the profession and its institutions. They may also involve fundamental reconsideration of the role of the teacher — does an information-transfer model created in an age of information scarcity apply equally well in our new age of information glut? Do the assembly-line schools created by the Carnegie Commission in the 1910s to serve the needs of an assembly-line economy still work today?We probably need to rethink as well what it means to be a student — what skills are needed, who gets to define them, how (or even if) they ought to be grouped. Growing up into today’s world is a lot more complicated than it used to be. We undoubtedly need many alternatives — some competency or job based, some more conceptual, some probably even fanciful. Whatever we do, it won’t be just tinkering at the margins — we will have radical change in education, one way or another.I started out this post thinking that it might be more helpful than it’s probably turned out to be. But like any teacher convinced of the value of his/her ideas, I’m offering it up here in the hope that it may convey some value to you. Let me know what you think.Like what you’ve read?
