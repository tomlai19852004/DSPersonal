Vogue Model &amp; Artist Christina Kruse invites me into her studio and home upstate N.Y.4.18.15 Kerhonkson, NYUD: Okay, why don’t you start by describing your place up here?CK: The house is very simple and was built in 1964. It was very dated when I bought it. I got rid of some walls, ripped out the carpet, put in a new kitchen, new floors — basically redid it all.UD: It feels very Swedish. Do you know anything about the previous owner?CK: I like simple lines, not too much stuff anywhere — a clean-cut place.The former owners were a couple from Manhattan; they bought the house because it was close to the Peg Leg Bates Country Club down the hill. Peg Leg Bates was a dancer, entertainer and performer in the 50’s — 60’s, he decided to build a resort for the black community up here -it was a roaring place — Sammy Davis Jr., Aretha Franklin, they all stayed up here, performed and, from what I understand, had a fantastic time. One might think of it as being similar to a Hamptons for the black people of its day.When I cleaned out the garage I found hundreds of Jazz and Blues vinyls — an amazing collection.UD: Very cool!Her sun drenched living space.CK: A lady bought the country club 3 years ago. I believe, she went to inspect the property and got hit by lighting and died. Go figure.UD: Wow, Speaking of lightning, how do new ideas come to you?CK: Well, usually it starts when I notice a structure that provokes a thought or two or when I notice a structure that’s structurally unsound or has fallen. It could be through a conversation or while driving–there is a lot of thinking in the car. I continuously create 3 dimensional objects in my mind, draw them, and if I like them, eventually start building.I used to take a lot of pictures, which I don’t do much anymore.UD: Why is that?CK: I have come to realize that I like to work with my hands. I like moving things and building things, which I’ve only really discovered since I turned another garage into a studio 3 or 4 years ago.I have also discovered a great love for cement — mixing and coloring cement. Wood and metal are two other materials I have come to really like to work with since being here.
