On the future of architecture in the next 5–10 yearsI would like to believe that digital design tools will eventually pass a threshold and become a facsimile to the physical handling of objects. I suspect this will require several technologies to merge together, including VR / AR, tactile feedback, and 3D gesture interfaces. When these technologies mature, and by that I mean when a 5 year old can figure it out and start making intentional shapes with these technologies, then we’ll truly have an intuitive way to design in the digital realm that is on-par with the analog. That’s when there will be a real paradigm shift in the way we design.On advice he would give his younger selfNot that my younger self would ever listen, but I would say try to be less enamored with technology for technology’s sake — it’s great to be fluent in the latest software or fabrication technique, but that fascination and the resulting production can often be a type of embellishment that distracts from the quality of the idea itself. I had to learn this the hard way. I would also tell my younger self to read more — more broadly and more frequently, you can discover so many connections through reading. And to be less cautious as a designer, the anxiety of needing to make sure everything looks good is actually a huge handicap, instead one should experiment more wildly and feel comfortable with making some ugly stuff.This post was previously published on blog.modelo.io on 3/24/16.
