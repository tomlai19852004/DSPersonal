In his book Teaching 2030, Barnett Berry states that schools are cluttered with the detritus of past traditions. He continues by saying that there should be no sacred cows in education. All aspects of brick and mortar schools should be challenged. I couldn’t agree more.When I walked through the Summit’s bright blue foyer, I didn’t think I would find anything useful for my classroom. I thought it would be a lot of bells and whistles — and that my district’s bureaucracy would keep me from ever getting these amazing innovations. I assumed there would be nothing for me to take back to my third grade students the next day. I was right in that regard. There isn’t much for me to take back to my students now.But this conference isn’t just about my students today. What about my students of tomorrow? I can be stuck in the detritus of the past, or I can learn to reshape my practice for a new generation. That is what I am taking with me from this Summit.I have grown tired of sitting on the sidelines. This conference has shown me that I am responsible to know what entrepreneurs are trying to put into my field. I can reach out to them and start a dialogue. I am now officially sitting at the table and giving my voice to the discussions that will impact my practice.Bright is made possible by funding from the New Venture Fund, and is supported by The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
