What is architecture? Every architect should ask this crucial question in his work.Architecture is a mystery or a human natural mission.We as human have to live on this planet.We have to live in the nature.And we organise this way of living, I call this the road to Architecture.Architecture is the spacial connection between Man and Nature. It is a dialogue and a spiritual relationship.Architecture is always linked to nature and in my opinion architecture defines a new nature.A human nature.LOVE___AD___
