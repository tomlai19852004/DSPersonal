Building a Better Teacher… From Day OneWhat does it take to truly prepare a teacher to be successful from day one in the classroom?It’s literally a multi-billion dollar question. Is the answer a teacher preparation program that puts new teachers in the classroom who are ready to teach effectively in their first year? Conventional wisdom in K-12 education says doing so is nearly impossible. We expect new teachers to be in survival mode, and if they get through their first year in one piece, they’ve succeeded.We believe we can do better to prepare new teachers, but it isn’t easy. How would you change teacher preparation to help teachers enter the classroom ready to not just survive, but thrive?Share your thoughts with us here. Next week, we’ll weigh in with some of our own thinking.
