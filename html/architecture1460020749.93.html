Architecture Spotlight: London (Evelyn Grace Academy and The Park Tower Knightsbridge)Historically, architecture in London has had strong influences from Roman, Tudor, Victorian and Gothic traditions. The Great Fire of 1666, as well as reconstruction post World War II played significant roles in architectural approaches to residential and industrial design in this region, and would help pave the way for the adoption of foreign architectural expressions/movements (e.g. Brutalism). Today London is a global hub for architectural and engineering design in large part due to its relatively stable economy and diverse influences. These themes are reflected in the subjects for this article: The Evelyn Grace Academy, The Park Tower Knightsbridge and acclaimed architect Zaha Hadid. It’s also worth mentioning that the structures in this article are situated in locations featured in my upcoming novel: Brixton and Knightsbridge respectively. So without further ado, let’s get to it.The Park Tower KnightsbridgeDesigned by the late and legendary Swiss-British architect Richard Seifert and built by contractor Y.J. Lovell &amp; Company, this building has been through various transformations over the years and today is regarded as a premiere luxury destination in an already upscale part of London. Known for its unmistakable cylindrical shape, construction on this property began in 1970 and it opened in 1973 under the name ‘Skyline Park Tower hotel.’ Purchased by Starwood Hotels in 2013, it was renamed as the Park Tower Knightsbridge in line with extensive renovations done that year. Leading the hotels rebirth was celebrated interior designer Anita Rosato, who was charged with redesigning the hotels lobby, lounge and bar. The hotel contains 280 rooms including 22 suites that offer panoramic views of London. Other Amenities include a fitness center and the award winning ‘One-O-One’ Seafood Restaurant.Reception at Park Tower Knightsbridge designed by Anita RosatoViews from the Park Tower KnightsbridgeLounge at Park Tower Knightsbridge designed by Anita RosatoEvelyn Grace Academy© Luke HayesSituated in Brixton lies the Evelyn Grace Academy (2010), a remarkable piece of modern architecture that successfully combines the elements of functionality and visual appeal. Designed by acclaimed architect Zaha Hadid, the structure is actually four schools merged into one (middle and upper grades) and designed to hold 1,200 students. The architectural brilliance brought by Zaha Hadid and her team (honorable salutes to Patrick Schumaker and Matthew Hardcastle for additional contributions to design) allowed for individuality for each school within the connected spaces.

She is Iraqi-British, and is renowned the world over. She is known for her futuristic, unconventional approach to design that tend to focus on curves and fragmented, bold pieces. She has won multiple awards, including the Stirling Prize in both 2010 and 2011 (FYI the Stirling Prize is the most prestigious award for architecture in England). I have to say that I did not know anything about Ms. Hadid until I decided to write this article, and after studying some of her work I am now a fan. Check out the images below for examples of her work:Heydar Aliyev Center (this building in Azerbaijan won the Museum Design of the Year award in 2014, making Zaha Hadid the first woman to win that prize.The ‘MAXXI,’ (National Museum of the 21st Century Arts) in Rome, Italy. This design earned Zaha Hadid the Stirling Prize in 2010.520 West 28th Street Luxury Apartments, New York. This is currently a work in progress, and the above image is concept art/a rendering for the project. I chose to include this project as I read about it when it first began, and back then I was unfamiliar with Zaha Hadid’s work. For all my readers in NYC, might be worth taking a trip up to this location when it is completed to have a look. You can check out this project’s page by clicking HERE.From what I’ve seen, I like Ms. Hadid and her crew. Check out the below video made by her firm, Zaha Hadid Architects. I especially love their focus on diversity and innovation, a great proven testament to the fact that value driven concepts can come from anyone regardless of race or socioeconomic standing.I hope you enjoyed my writing on architecture in England, one of many locations featured in my upcoming novel, Eteka: Rise of the Imamba©.
