How to Impress Your Teacherby Ashley BaylesI read the article How I Got on Medium and was instantly impressed. As a teacher, if I saw that my student had not done their homework, but they had done everything that Vishwa Shah wrote about in her Medium article, I would be beaming with pride and not even care about the homework.In the grand scheme of things, I would much rather have a student who is passionate about something that involves reading and writing than one who is passively doing the homework assignments without questioning them or thinking about how they are relevant to their own life. Students can´t always identify allusions or parody, but they know how to apply them in their own writing and to me that is far more important. Yes, on their exams they need to be able to identify it and explain the effects, but as a writer that uses them effectively, my student has already shown me that he or she knows how it affects their readers. Forget exams; this is life.Vishwa says that she “detests English class for the difficulties it presents,” yet she seems to have mastered the subject area in her publishing on Medium. She has a purpose and an audience that she wants to reach and likes the feedback she gets by interacting with that audience.As a teacher, I can give feedback, but I am just one voice. My students need other mentors and a community in order for their writing to have traction. Medium offers Vishwa exactly what she needs, and as a teacher I think it would be nearly impossible for me to offer a student that quality and quantity of feedback. I wish more students would reach out and find ways to learn in a way that works for them, like Vishwa has.Vishwa, I would give you an A+ for your work. Yet, as you probably know, that grade means nothing in comparison to what you have already accomplished and learned through this process.
