A Painting That Is An Act Is Inseparable From The Biography Of The ArtistAn Original Acrostic Poem(Quote referencing Rosenberg’s The American Action Painters)Rachel TroutA heart world plucked by wars of fear and ceaseless attachmentPainting tender willow trees, weeping beautifully on their pedestalsThat puppy-whimper for innumerable accounts of attention butIs in searching, from stinging cheeks and rug burned throats, for an endless and orbital sphere of affectionAn ethereal veil glowing green of new lifeAct like the possessed joker, summoning foolish children with lies that the deep end will feel just like puddle jumpingIs a facade to invite The Others to the familiar first kiss of honey suckles but isInseparable from the truth that the pretty flowers are rooted in their mother’s mucky rotFrom the craters on their muddy face plate and their poisoned internal windThe tug of rope stomach apprehending their suicide of ignorance but the nearing of birth of a believerBiography born with the umbilical cord ax-chopped at conceptionOf a reality whose murky fog swamps invite the brightest bugsThe ripped canopy of greenery disclosing peaceful psychedelics on a Gang of Cosmos skyArtist as firefly that the dumb children trap and suffocate at their bedside
