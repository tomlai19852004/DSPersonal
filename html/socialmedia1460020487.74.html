Let me just underline here what is going on. Twitter is showing me tweets by accounts my five year-old, barely literate kid follows that I don’t follow. He followed these accounts because he follows any account that twitter recommends. Some of these accounts are tweeting items of interest to me because the kid was prompted to follow people who are essentially friends of my friends, weak ties. It also selects tweets to push at me that have already been met with approval by users in the form of retweets or favorites. So the algorithm is doing quite a nice job of showing me things I like. I’ve even decided to follow some of these folks via @beebaaahp.When twitter first announced this algorithmic feature, similar to the Facebook news feed, many critics cried fowl. Zeynep Tufekci perceptively complained that this change will deprive users of individual agency to shape their feeds, and will make it less likely for some content from less influential accounts to surface. Without wanting to give this critical perspective short shrift — I subscribe to Tufekci’s point of view—I also want to praise the algorithm for helping to circulate productive knowledge. It works so well, even a user who doesn’t really read can participate in its proper functioning. This is amazing, and kind of scary. But it works only within circumscribed social worlds, and it reinforces their coherence rather than opening them up to diverse and different voices. The echo chamber and “daily me” qualities of social networks are strong as ever.So this algorithmic process says something about the constitution of our online networks, and how much they reinforce a distorted sense of the world being made up of people like us. Of course, a very young child isn’t “like us” in some ways. But in others, those accidents of birth that give us our culturally specific experiences provides strong continuity between generations, passing along various kinds of privilege or its absence. Even without communicating very much verbally, Noah’s twitter experience is that of the child of two college professors/media scholars in the midwestern United States. Even on the internet where so much is fluid and interstitial, the continuity of identity and its specificity and rootedness in family and community can be pretty strong.For now, @beebaaahp seems to delight in the pleasures of the interface, of giving and receiving notifications, of blurry selfies and dolphin emoji. But the only predictable feature of childhood is constant change. I imagine he’ll abandon his twitterstream soon enough for other hijinks and new communities. I think we’ll really miss these days.Me: Is there anything else you want to say?@beebaaahp: That everyone has amazing tweets.
