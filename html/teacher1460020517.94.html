My high school calculus teacher had a simple solution for this in the 1980s — he made EVERYTHING open book. For exams you could use whatever you could bring into the classroom with you — because he said that “in the real world, if you need to solve a problem, you won’t be prevented from using your books… so instead I’m going to teach you to THINK and learn HOW to solve problems. You will demonstrate that in class on exams. There will be no homework.” BEST teacher I had.
