You’re not a true socialite unless you brunch it every weekend, but doing so is expensive and necessitates having friends. So next time you miss out because you’re too tired, the bank account is running low, or you just don’t have anyone to go with, feel free to use these readily available stock images to maintain your essential social media façade.1.Try captioning this one “Bottomless mimosas!!!!”2.Captioning this one #WhatHangover? will not only make people jealous about how much fun you had at brunch, but also subtly cue them in to how much fun you had the night before.3.Share this one of people no one in your social circle will recognize — you’ll look pretty impressive for having a diverse social life outside of them.4.Caption this bad boy with something like “Went to Paris for brunch. Totally worth it!”5.Oh fuck yeah, this one has an avocado in it.
