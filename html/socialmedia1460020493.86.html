Why Excessive Social Media Use is the Cognitive Equivalent of Being An Athlete Who SmokesBoth our personal and professional lives are increasingly built around these sources of distraction. From a cognitive perspective, that’s like being an athlete who smokes. — Cal NewportAbout a month ago I deleted nearly all the social media apps with the exception of instagram from my phone. I made my home screen minimal (i.e. removed every app from it)and I disabled Safari.I turned off my phone for several hours during the day.I also blocked Facebook, email and other distracting websites not for just the 1-hour I usually set aside to write in the morning, but from 7pm-10am.Why would I do something like this? I did it in service of what author Cal Newport refers to as Deep Work, the ability to focus on a cognitively demanding task for an extended period of time (which happens to be writing in my case)Chris Bailey, who runs a website called A Life of Productivity, says that “not all tasks are created equal.” A few things that we do create a disproportionate amount of value in our lives and our work. It’s the 80/20 rule at work.When I sat down and analyzed my activities, three emerged as the highest value things that I work on each day.Interviewing people for the Unmistakable Creative PodcastWriting articles/guest posts/anything related to marketing my bookWorking on the manuscript for my book.I realized that almost everything else in my life (email, social media, mindless browsing) shouldn’t take more than an hour a day.I decided to see what would happen if I basically declared war against distractions.Social Media, Dopamine and a False Sense of ProductivityFacebook, can increase loneliness and decrease satisfaction with life. — Kelly McgonigalHave you ever had a day when you’ve been connected to twitter, Facebook, and email from the moment you wake up until the moment you shut your computer down? And then instead of truly being unplugged, you’re still connected via your smart phone until you struggle to fall asleep. The endless notifications cause an addictive surge of dopamine giving us a false sense of productivity, and a sense of fulfillment that doesn’t last.We’ve learned the Facebook has a mental health problem.We’ve gotten so addicted to our phones we have digital detox camps.Can you imagine going back in time to 1994 and telling people “so you know AA, yeah, in 20 years, they’re going to have the equivalent for people who use their phones.”Excessive social media use decreases our satisfaction with our lives because we forget that nobody on the internet is living the lives we think they are. Even those of us who regularly use all these services are well aware of them. And nobody changed the world by updating their Facebook status 25 times a day, with the possible exception of Mark Zuckerberg, but that’s excusable since he invented it.I’ve been pretty religious about decoupling myself from toxic environments, But it wasn’t until, a recent conversation with Cal Newport, about his new book Deep Work, that I really grasped how much damage digital distractions cause in our lives.If you’re smoking outside of your practice as a professional athlete, when you get to your actual game you're going to struggle. I think it’s the same for distraction. If your attention is constantly shifting to things that are novel or interesting, if you can’t tolerate boredom, it’s going to be really hard when it’s time to focus to actually do it.Just think about that. What seems like a harmless checkin to Flipboard, Twitter, or Medium while you’re standing in line at the grocery store is actually reducing your capacity to do work that matters, and to focus on a cognitively demanding task when you need to.As I’ve developed my habit of writing 1000 words a day, I’ve gotten quite good at resisting distraction for certain time blocks using tools like Heyfocus and Rescuetime. But when I decided to push my ability to resist digital distractions to an extreme, the results convinced me of the virtues of deep work.My ability to write for longer periods of time went up.I was less scatterbrained during our weekly team meeting.I was more mindful of my media consumption habits, and instead of clickbait, I got around to watching some amazing talks on 99u.com and reading more of the books I wanted to read.Needless to say I can’t recommend Cal’s New book highly enough. You might be regularly doing the digital equivalent of smoking a pack a day. Reading this book will change the way you work.I’m the host and founder of The Unmistakable Creative Podcast.
