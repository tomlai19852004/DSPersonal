Roadside Architecture Contraptions: a prefab housing tour of Willits, CAI regularly visit friends who live just outside the town of Willits, in Mendocino County, two hours north of San Francisco. Driving the three miles between their property (“Summit Station”) and town, I’ve gradually noticed there’s a remarkable range of prefab, self-built, movable, and vernacular dwellings there along the way. Here’s a quick tour of these everyday wonders.A single-wide trailer home, tidily nestled under an open shed roof. No shame in its game! It makes me think of the giant statues that supposedly were often nestled inside ancient Greek temples, or Charles Moore’s charming 1983 book on architectural types, The Cabin / The Temple / The Trailer:There’s every imaginable kind of trailer, RV, and vehicle dwelling to be seen along my way into town. Here are two of the more unusual ones:A regular “box truck” aka panel truck, modified into a dwellable trailer. I like this approach, because a box truck cargo area is a full-height, capacious space, in contrast to the curving and cluttered space typical of most trailers and tiny houses. So it can demonstrate to people how roomy, in fact “room”-like, even a truck-movable box space can be. Plus they’re light and relatively easy to modify, all the while sitting on their own transport — it’s like a better shipping-container house.Recently there was international media coverage of a box truck converted to dwelling by a Google employee, who was living in the truck at Google’s campus in Mountain View.A less ad-hoc and quite common form of living in a moving truck, however, is a sleep cabin on a “semi” ie tractor-trailer. Like this one seen today parked next to Willits’ main intersection (Main St and Commercial St.), possibly with driver sleeping inside.Prefab housing plays a big role in recreational dwelling, aside from permanent and work-nomadic forms. This is well illustrated by the thriving KOA (Kampgrounds of America) site I pass on the way into town. KOA, founded in 1962, has 500 sites around US — an alternate housing archipelago experienced by millions of vacationing Americans, and the world’s largest private campsite chain.Sites can have different themes; this one is “Western,” and includes a depot on the former California Western Railroad connecting Willits to Fort Bragg, also known as the Skunk Train, which now operates as a “heritage” (tourist/recreational) railroad. KOA these days offers a type of architectural tourism, promoting various special cabin and trailer types as premium amenities. At some campgrounds you can stay in a classic Airstream trailer; KOA Willits has many of the successful Deluxe Cabin models like below, which also come in more log-cabin styles, These are, of course, kit houses, produced in huge quantities to deploy across the whole KOA chain.Up the road at Summit Station, we’re considering possibilities for a alternative building experiment/showcase village. If we could franchise this with 1/100 the success KOA has had, we’d be very happy.I’m also wondering if there might be opportunity for KOA to venture into the territory of urban sophisticates — currently not on its map much, or it on theirs — and offer, say, a Modern or Bauhaus themed park with cabins inspired by 20th C classics such as Mies van der Rohe’s 1929 Barcelona Pavilion or Le Corbusier’s Maison Dom-Ino (below — open air!). I’d totally go to KOA Bauhaus.Moving on, below is a curious trapezoidal building, on which it seems they took typical standing-seam metal roofing and just continued it down the sides. Hey it’s durable and easy to get/install, I can relate, even if the result looks rather bomb-shelter.This neighbor’s roadside property, below, is a veritable catalogue of building structures. Clearly a true maker spirit lives there. Here’s a 40-foot container, a classic trailer, and Dutch-Gabled prefab shed, among their wide collection.On the same property, along with miscellaneous other sheds, boats, trailers, and earth-moving equipment, there’s a great stack of roof trusses, enough for an ample warehouse or small village of houses. I like the feel: it’s like, if you have wings you can fly! if you have roof trusses you can span space!The next one’s not a dwelling, but I admire the clean, purposeful huge beams and porch overhang of this wood-mill structure. For reference, in foreground a prefab shed and a 20-foot shipping container.Shipping containers are pretty ubiquitous around here, on commercial and residential (or possibly, often in fact, mixed-use) properties. It’s a global building block, giving humble corners of the world everywhere a share of a truly cosmopolitan architecture.Containers of course get adapted to local conditions, and here’s a nice case of container dressed with a gable roof, good for keeping hot sun and rain off.I shared this with architect acquaintance and eminent container-housing critic Mark Hogan in San Francisco. He tweeted &amp; reposted it with comment, “The purest definition imaginable of ’doing it wrong.’” I thought the gable add-on was sort of charming, but I’m funny that way, and I take his point.Moving on, nearby is neighbor Dave Bixler’s Garfield Construction company specializing in “timber frame” building: the type of large post-and-beam, carpentry-jointed construction that was once typical in Europe, US etc. It was overtaken by forest depletion or new methods like the “stick” or ballon-frame wood construction used for most residential construction in US for last 100+ years. Timber frame is still sometimes used as a specialty method, such as for custom houses, flexible-plan “post and beam” commercial construction, or temple building in E. Asia.timber-frame sign front at Garfield Construction, in Willits, CA.Bixler discussed the merits of reviving timber-frame methods in an interesting 2012 Willits News feature:A timber frame house just keeps on getting stronger and stronger for 50 years as the wood warps and changes, Bixler said. A timber frame structure, with its inherent beauty and craftsmanship, will last 500 to 600 years if maintained.Yet because all the structure’s components are pre-fabricated in the shop, “timber frame structures can go up in a day or two”, allowing for high efficiency and flexibility in construction schedule.You might even mix this old-school timber-frame prefab with something new like a metal popup shed building, as in fact Dave has done on the entrance to his company’s offices here. Kind of a ceremonial arch, like in the antique South Asian shrine piece he’s got next to it:In a more humble vein, here’s part of the dentist’s office behind on of my local cafe spots, Paradise. There’s something appealing and usable for me about this economical structure: is it small house with front door, or garage, or just an extra room? whichever you need. Punch in some windows? You got it!Behind it is a classic metal prefab car-port structure. I stopped to admire the details.The arch form is totally functional — curved at sides to allow roof and part of side-wall without a seam and while covering the frame — yet the result is a relatively unusual and graceful boat-prow form. It’s close to what in Gothic architecture is known as an Ogee arch, i.e. arch formed from two ‘S’-curves.“Porta San’ Alippio,” 13th C, at Piazza San Marco, Venice (photo by Marjorie Och)Typical of prefab structures, the structure is unprepossessing but shows careful thought and crafting in many details. For example, how precisely the arch section of the aluminum poles are crimped and curved to perfectly fit the roof panels:Below is a fairly contemporary Quonset Hut, where some eccentric recluse probably lives some of the time above a building-experiments workshop. Quonsets are among the most pervasive and iconic prefab building structures, cropping up worldwide after mass deployment by Allied forces in WWII and surplus production; many are still in use 75+ years later, and they’re still being manufactured and developed.I’ve come to quite admire Quonset huts as marvels of structural and materials efficiency + simplicity. Originating as the “Nissen hut” created by British engineers in WWI, this type has greatly evolved, becoming much more sophisticated, yet simple to build. Latter-day Quonsets such as the one pictured are, amazingly, built from nothing but many pieces of a single metal sheet form — paper-thin, yet extremely strong due to multiple orthogonal corrugations/bends — and one type of bolt and square nut. (for the main semicircle structure, that is; you also need a concrete or other floor, and end walls).The span pieces are identical, curved sections about two feet by eight feet, and are even designed to stack perfectly. The stacks of them shown below on two shipping pallets are enough for a structure 30 x 40 feet at base, like the one pictured above. They crank these out of a press from ordinary sheet metal, the whole thing can be put up by two unskilled workers in a few days, and once up it’s practically indestructible and weatherproof (as long as end-walls are built correctly).Finally, here’s an ancient barn, settling peacefully into the ground — the first story now fully crumbled, but redwood siding on the gable front mostly holding up shiningly. Just over the hill behind it runs the old California Western Railroad connecting Willits to Fort Bragg on the Pacific Coast, over which travelled much of the vast redwood harvests used to rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. Sooner or later the redwood siding here might be turned into someone’s new deck or coffee table — it too shall pass, and be put together again another way.Story short url: http://bit.ly/roadside-architecture-contraptions.
