As an artist the hardest part to gaining success over social media is promoting artwork while finding the time and energy to learn new techniques, expand the horizon and still apply that to new designs until a successful one is created.I remember the time I thought it would be impossible to make characters real because I never understood anatomy like the professionals who painted concepts 8 hours a day and visited models in the studio 3 times a week. People like Marco Menco, and Daryl Mandryk were some skilled employable artists I met and who gave me some great advice, but hearing that I was young and had time to master my trade was not the ideal solution. After years of studying painting, color theory, make-up fx, photography, drawing courses and traditional painting mediums I have come to ends knowing that it is possible to create concepts that visually demonstrate technical features and correct lighting of a character. Practice can never be undervalued, but passion is even more important. My heart always enjoyed character design even when artists told me it was a 1 to 50 ratio of character artists to environment guys! My theory is, if you have drive inside of you to do something, even if it seems impossible, eventually no matter how many times you fail, you will get better and your work will demonstrate some value at some point. From there its a matter of attending to the demand of the industry and aiming to impress a studio that fits your style of work and your goals.The question is, how much time do you put into social media advertising and how much do you put into your artwork and your ability to try new things?The easy answer, is test out different methods and gage what is giving the best response. Generally the quality of work must increase but also appeal to the audience you selected.Luca Giorgio, Thunder Bay, Canadawww.facebook.com/lucadesigns4uwww.youtube.com/youtubedrummerwww.giorgiostudios.com www.lucagiorgio.comFashion Photography: www.modelmayhem.com/lucagiorgio
