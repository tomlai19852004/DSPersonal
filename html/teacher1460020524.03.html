JB: That’s funny. I’m a math teacher by background. I don’t have a computer science major. Somebody in my school district came to me and said, ‘We’re trying to get more AP courses in our school. Do you want to teach the AP Java class?’ I’m like, ‘Um, I really don’t know if I’m qualified to do that. The only programming background I have is Fortran and very limited at that.’ And they were like, ‘Oh, it will be okay. You’ll be fine.’ So I went to some summer training and really was way behind the curve my first year and it was very intimidating because it was a completely new field. But my advice to other teachers is: Go for it anyway. Push yourself and get into this field of educating people in computer science, because, a) I think computer science is very important and b) I think it’s attainable. It’s something that most people can do…Jeff Baker, a computer science teacher at Huntsville High School in Huntsville, AlabamaNP: When I took the Exploring Computer Science professional development course, I remember as a cohort we went through eight lessons over the course of the week, teaching each other different things, as teachers. Only three of those eight lessons had us using a computer. And I was somewhat taken aback because that’s not the way I was taught computer science… The process of thinking, looking at a problem and working with others — it’s very much that 21st century teaching that we keep hearing about, whether its math, science, social studies, it doesn’t matter. These kinds of critical skills of collaboration, communication and working together through a problem is the way to go, and it makes the class a lot more enjoyable, the kids aren’t sitting there silently. There’s a lot of conversation between the students, and as they’re teaching each other, they’re learning from each other.JB: One of the biggest takeaways we get from teaching computer science to our students is, it increases their level of tenacity. As you write a program, there is an evolution that takes place. You don’t necessarily expect it to work correctly the first time. But then you get to go through the debugging and the testing process and you get to find and correct your own mistakes, and then you get to visually see those corrections happening and you get immediate feedback, which is not something that you can get in some of the other courses that I’ve taught. Just watching the students develop a level of ‘stick-with-it-ness’, has been really exciting for me.—A conversation between Jessica Parsons, Milton High School, Milton, Massachusetts and David Petty, Winchester High School in Winchester, MassachusettsDavid Petty: Jessica, I had a question for you. We both have been teaching CS for quite a while. Where do you think CS education is going? Are you optimistic?Jessica Parsons: I’m optimistic. I know we’ve both been working closely on the Massachusetts standards for CS and technology. I think Massachusetts values it, and I see that our work hopefully will increase participation for all students in the state. I hope it’s something that all students in Massachusetts will take, and hopefully, throughout the country, it’s something that will be a requirement for students or just something that most students are taking very soon… How has your experience this year been teaching Exploring Computer Science?Jessica Parsons, a computer science teacher in Milton High School, Milton, Massachusetts“Through this event, some female students in the school’s Young Women’s group have expressed interest in Computer Science, and I have arranged for a female minority Software Engineer come and speak with the group.” — Jessica ParsonsDP: This is my first time. You’ve done it more than once, right?JP: Twice.DP: I think that one of the things that’s most enthralled me is the fact that I had a bunch of people who never would’ve thought of [taking] computer science and are completely engaged with what’s going on... How about you?JP: I really enjoy teaching ECS. I often I check in with students and ask: ‘How are you enjoying this class?’ And they say, ‘Interesting, fun, cool, I wish I’d taken this class earlier so I could take more computer science classes.’ It’s been a great experience. And the professional development has been effective in all my classes, not just ECS.DP: You taught AP CS for a while, as have I. Did anything surprise you teaching AP CS as opposed to Exploring Computer Science?JP: No. But it’s changed my AP CS A class. It can be taught in some of these ways that I do in Exploring Computer Science. And the kids that have taken Exploring Computer Science and are transitioning to CS A — the transition is much easier for them. It allows opportunities for students who may not have had success in AP CS A.DP: I agree with that. I feel like there’s a population of students that take AP CS A, that really have no background. Those students who don’t have any prior knowledge feel left out. By perhaps taking ECS, they will have done iteration, and done some Scratch and done problem-solving and breaking down the problem — all those ECS things will give them that leg up. That’s what I’m hoping for.JP: Also, because students in ECS work on pair programming and collaborative work, when they come to AP CS A, they automatically default to, ‘Let me work with someone else and see if they can help me out because they have different strategies that I may not have thought of before.’ They rely on each other a lot more.DP: I agree with that.

And that is such a huge benefit to all of my classes.—Want to hear from more computer science teachers about their experiences.
