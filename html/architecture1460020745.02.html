Mobile solution architecture — Part 1 — what are we building?The role of a mobile solution architect is to ask questions of the stakeholder wanting a mobile solution and to use your experience and judgement to make decisions and answer questions for the rest of the delivery team.In this first article I will look at the questions that need to be asked and answered in the initial phases of the project. This is more targetted to consumer facing apps, I’ll follow this up with more specific treatment for enterprise apps in a future article.Native app or mobile first website?Everyone wants a native app. Native apps however are more limiting in many ways than websites, particularly in the early days when you want to evolve your app rapidly. The web obviously also gives you much greater bang for your buck in terms of device coverage. So it is worth asking the question. Is a native app actually necessary?The most simple, valid commercial drive for a public native app is simply to have a presence in the app stores. Indeed this has rapidly become a hygiene factor for most brands.The most obvious technical requirements are push notifications, offline access or levering some of the more advanced hardware on modern devices.So it may well be that they are right to want a native app but there’s no harm in questioning it.How do the use cases fit into the digital landscape?How does this app complement the rest of the digital landscape. Mobile apps are best at targeted specific use cases. Are the prime phone use cases the same as the tablet use cases? Does the app duplicate functionality already provided on your website? How do they complement each other?A good example of a coherent strategy on this is Strava. Their website is built with some very advanced analytical features while the native app offers a lower level of analysis features but it is clearly obvious the prime use case is GPS tracking. It seems new features are tested on web before being filtered down into the native app.Should I build a prototype?When designing and evolving the initial app there is no substitute for running the app on real devices as early as possible. UX storyboards do a really poor job of conveying the overall user experience to stakeholders.If the app is relatively simple or you are comfortable with agile prioritisation then building an MVP and taking a lean approach is a good option. The success of this option hinges on how “M” you make your MVP. Be as aggressive as humanly possible.If the delivery is working to a fixed price or the app is complex and is hard to scope then a prototype is a really good idea. Many outsourced mobile shops will suggest this as a two phase delivery as it helps promote understanding and eliminates some risk prior to the build.Prototypes can be built with specific mobile prototyping tools such as proto.io, in HTML or as a rough throwaway prototype using native tooling. The higher the fidelity the more engaged your stakeholders or user testing groups will be but try not to gold plate the prototype as ultimately it will be thrown away.Which platforms should I support?iOS and Android right? Which OS versions are you going to test against? Which devices? Are you going to support tablets and phones? In the case of iOS the user base upgrades very quickly to new versions and there is a large, but limited set of devices to choose from. For Android the picture is much more complicated with fragmentation both across OS versions and devices in the wild.Pragmatism is called for. If you have a website already look at your analytics and use the 80/20 rule to pick the highest coverage for the least amount of platforms you can. Is there an OS upgrade due soon? Ensure you factor this in if it is likely to fall within the timescales for your initial launch as it may dramatically shift the landscape.Should I develop multiple platforms in parallel?It is going to be much more efficient to lead development on a single primary platform and only move the feature to the secondary platform(s) once it is user tested and optimised. Depending on the split of your user base you may choose to stagger features by as little as a 2 week sprint or do a concerted catch up effort every few months.How consistent should my apps be across platform?Don’t fight the platform. Each platform has a specific set of user interface standards. A good guide to ensure that apps feel native to the native platform is to follow the style of the bundled apps. The SDKs make adopting the standards easy.There are some significant differences. iOS generally uses a tab-based approach while Android uses fly out menus. Trying to standardise these across platforms will involve more work and result in a less natural feeling app on at least one of the platforms.Apply consistent branding and design language across platforms but try to resist the urge to over design the UX. The best apps (such as Twitter)are simple, adopt the platform styles and rely on fairly subtle branding to establish their identity. These are also the cheapest to develop.What support do I need for the lifetime of my app?You’re in it for the long run right? If you have budget for your app build have you factored in appropriate support costs.One certainty in mobile development is that things change and changes can break things. Users also expect to see regular updates to the release history for apps and will use the lack of updates to suggest that an app is becoming less relevant.Even if your feature set reaches maturity and is no longer actively developed, you need to plan for regular updates for the lifetime of your app. There are generally a minor and major OS upgrade twice a year for each platform. If your app relies on other APIs such as social networks these can also be subject to changes at fairly short notice. During active development I would suggest a cadence of 2–4 week updates continually. Once feature development tails off 8–16 week cadence is about right. It is worth having the resource for this on retainer as, for major events like significant OS changes, they will be in high demand when you need them most.Coming soonIn the next article I will look at questions relating to the delivery process such as tool selection, build and test approaches and choosing a product lifecycle. Part 3 will then focus on answering the questions around the technology itself that should be answered at an early stage.
