Enough talking, let’s give it a try.I’d hereby like to propose a pilot program: Ten artists, ten institutions, ten new residencies, in the United States and Canada. Each of them will happen at some point in 2015.The first step is to find institutions to host, and funders to pay for the residencies. For this first try, let’s assume a per-residency cost of $10,000.If you work for an institution (library, archive, museum) that would like to host an artist-in-residency, please fill out this form. The 10 pilot institutions will be selected with the intention to maximize diversity of size and variety of focus area.Once a set of institutions is identified, artists will be paired with specific institutions, through an open call and some kind of collaborative ‘dating’ process. The focus will be on linking artists to institutions that match their practice, as well as ensuring diversity and promoting community connections.Here’s the most important part: If you or your company would like to support a pilot residency (or several residencies) (or all of the residencies), please get in touch. At some point it might make sense to set up a crowd-funding page of some variety, but for now I’ll keep it simple and ask you to e-mail me. As I learn more about potentials for funding, I’ll update this page, or post a follow-up.**Of course it’s possible that no one will read this post, or that no institutions will apply to host residents, or that no one will be willing to foot the bill. If that’s the case (I hope it’s won’t be), I personally promise to fund at least one of these residencies, so at least the idea will start to move forward. The goal to have an artist-in-residence in every library, archive and institution may be a long ways off, but if we take action we can see the first steps towards that goal in the coming weeks and and months, instead of years and decades.—* A short note on funding: I won’t receive any financial benefit whatsoever from this endeavor. I won’t hold a fee of any kind, won’t funnel anything through my company, and won’t apply for or take part in any of the funded residencies. **** I do, however, hope to visit some cool libraries.
