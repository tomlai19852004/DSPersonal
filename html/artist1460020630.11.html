Bowie was the first artist I ever loved.My dad was a huge fan, and he’d sit me down and play the vinyl at me over and over, and I’d read the notes and run my fingers over the images of this alien being and the things coming out of his head. All my life he’s been there, a constant, a reminder to push yourself, never rest, keep changing, stay excited.I’m estranged from my Dad now, haven’t seen him for a few years. Today is my own son’s birthday. I’m going to give him a hug and sit him down and play him some Bowie and tell him that it’s OK to be as weird, and as individual, and as spectacular as you want, and you’ll never need to apologize for it.
