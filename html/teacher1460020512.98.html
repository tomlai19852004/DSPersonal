Sam ChiversWilmington, United KingdomTechnology has already completely reshaped the classroom in recent years, and I think it’s set to continue on this trajectory. Although still in it’s infancy, I think augmented reality (AR)—the overlaying of audio and visual computer-generated information onto real-world environments through wearable technology such as Google Glass—could become a truly powerful teaching aid in years come. It will help make concepts that are fairly theoretical, like the human neural system, much easier to grasp. At the same time, it could be really fun and make the classroom of the future more mobile, flexible, and connected.The development of holographic technologies could replace or at the very least complement the electronic blackboard, creating 3-D visualizations, and at some point I think this could interact with AR in interesting ways.Some things in the classroom should remain constant. No amount of technology can replace the subtle skills of a great teacher.Gif by Chris Phillips for Bright.Bright is made possible by funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
