Anyone know who the bald headed teacher is — w4mRaymore, MissouriMissed Connectionspost id: 5477218581Every morning I walk my dog past your elementary school and watch you greet every student with a smile.On mornings like today, I feel the frost chew through the soles of my canvas shoes and bites at my toes. But early spring does nothing to freeze my guilty thoughts of you. The steam from your coffee cup cuts through the dense air caressing your lips. I can feel it from across the parking lot.I wish someone could tell me who you are.
