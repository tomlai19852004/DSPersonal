Telex: 6731689. The deal was finalized at 17:00 hours. Please consider using your transferred funds to purchase something else, perhaps one of those NutriBullet things as your motherâ€™s on this weird health kick lately.Yours in Krishna,DadThanks for the ðŸ’› Medium!!Check out Slackjaw if you like the funny.
