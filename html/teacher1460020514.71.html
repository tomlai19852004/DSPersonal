10 Things You Are Unlikely To Hear If You Are An Elementary School Teacher“Welcome to our school. You will be given one full hour for lunch, one full hour for a planning period, and all staff meetings are optional.”“Standardized tests will be given once every three years.”“Where should we go out for lunch today?”“This year you will have 15 students and one full-time teaching assistant.”“Too many teachers were finishing their report cards ahead of schedule. Please wait until the due date to turn them into the office.”“Teachers do not have to perform recess duty during rain, snow, sleet, or hail.”“Our state of the art photocopy machine is super easy to figure out. It never breaks, jams, or runs out of toner.”“I was up with a sick child all last night so I just coasted through the day.
