It’s fascinating how different the books are for artists and designers in business. I still find the whole art world basically insufferable. I will never understand the supposed greats. Our engineering school was next to the art college and we’d wander the halls and laugh at the bizarre crap. The story goes that a vase smashed on the floor and the janitors left it for weeks because they weren’t sure if it was intentionally art or an actual accident. That’s the sort of thing that freaks me out, that’s the sort of uselessness I dislike. The old jokes: “what does a bachelor of arts say? ‘would you like fries with that?’” and the weird kids in my art classes over the years who did sort of end up like that.What I’m trying to say is, I have no idea how to reconcile all of this stuff.On one hand I’ve read dozens if not hundreds of financial books over the years, on entrepreneurship and design and startups and development and hardware engineering, on investment and tax law and boring white collar “this sounds like a Patrick Bateman monologue” type lifestyle gurus. On the other, I find most of those business types far too stuffy and structured, just building for money instead of building to make the product that they’d love to see real.That last sentence is damning for me. That’s the crap I want to do, because there’s so much inside me wanting to be made, wanting to get out. But isn’t that identical to making the thing that’s “in your heart”? Isn’t that the hand-wavey nonsense I dislike?And maybe it all collapses down to something like “I AM an artist, but my art is totally not what your art is, or, what the general conception of what art is supposed to be”Which then begs to ask “am I merely afraid of calling myself that because of what other people would think or assume about me?” because in that case I have two answers: “screw them, I don’t care what they think” and “yeah, that’s hauntingly close, and I want to hide behind the word designer because I think it sounds more intelligent and productive, because I personally judge artists very aggressively”And maybe that’s the root of this whole thing — that I look down on artists. I’m afraid to call myself that because in my head it means lowering myself to that. In my head artists are still the people on the fifth page of the newspaper photographed with some hideous abstract statue that’s supposed to be a metaphor for the Jungian psychology of modern society in an era where cell phone interconnectivity has overcome primal social connections and all I see is some papier mâché and wax crayons melted over it with a heat gun. It’s not some higher abstraction of thought, it’s a fire hazard left under some hot gallery lights for a few weeks.So we’re left with the same thoughts. We’re just left with ‘I can be an artist and that’s just not my style of art’Maybe, maybe that’s just how it is.
