A Way OutThinking about an exit plan took me months to figure out. In that regard, quitting social media altogether was the worst option possible. No matter what I do, or how hard I tried, I would always come back.I realized it had to come from within.I came across a various multitude of ideas about self-perception while undergoing therapy from anxiety. Only one inspired me to dig deeper and left a tremendous impact on me and therefore a huge change in the way I live.This journey taught me that social media addiction is not a website’s fault. The challenge is to be honest, let myself embrace vulnerability, and seek compassionate connection only from people who have earned the right to listen. I used to be an addict because I couldn’t fully bond with anything else, yet I still have a chance to claim my own story, that was a major relief.Within this new context, social media can serve me as the valuable tool it is, I learned that only a poor workman blames his tools.
