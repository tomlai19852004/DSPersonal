Screw Success: Failure is What Being an Artist is All About.It was Saturday February 7, 2015, I was with my fellow acting students on a weekend trip to Toronto to immerse ourselves in good theatre. We had just finished seeing what I can genuinely say is one of the greatest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen and we were now meeting the actors in a post-show Q&amp;A session. At the time, all of us were first year students so one of the questions asked was “what advice would you give yourself as a first year in acting school?” what one actor was about to say, would transform my entire perspective on how to approach being an actor. He first paused for a moment or two, and then this is what he said:“Fail — then get back up and fail even harder; keep failing. You can’t learn much from success.”The room fell silent, I remember being alarmed, not by the frankness of his answer, but by how true it was. Before that, the artist in me was being bullied by the perfectionist in me.Anytime I was onstage, the artist couldn’t live in the moment because of the perfectionist’s voice screaming “you forgot your blocking you failure, and they seem really bored — No don’t look at them you fool, that’s breaking one of the biggest rules of theatre acting! Seriously, don’t you know anything? Now you can’t even focus on your performance…” it would go on and on and on. When I finished performing, the voice would never let it go as I rode the bus home, it kept me awake at night and it distracted me from other work. I couldn’t turn it off.About a week after that trip, I was back at school, about to go on and perform a self-written monologue that I had rehearsed the crap out of. The perfectionist was giving me a hard time by going over every microscopic detail of my preparation as if messing up on any given one would be the worst thing that could possibly happen. Then I remembered what that actor said in the Q&amp;A Session; I took a deep breath and for the first time ever, silenced the perfectionist by saying three words to myself:“Let’s go fail”…Then I walked onstage.I don’t remember too much of what happened, but I remember feeling more present, relaxed and focussed than ever before. I was able to fully embody this character I had created, not by perfecting each mannerism, but by allowing my imagination to bring this person to me. It was a beautiful feeling of artistic freedom.Whatever your artistic pursuit is, the need to be perfect will not motivate you nearly as much as it restricts you. The creative mind can’t function under pressure, and even if you create something amazing, the perfectionist will always find a reason why it could be better.I see a lot of people try to defeat perfectionism by saying “well, I know perfection doesn’t exist so as long as I’ve done my best, that’s all that really matters.” This is a very good step in the right direction, but it’s not enough to silence the perfectionists demands.Let’s be real, when have you ever truly done the best that you can possibly do on something? Unless you’ve spent every single waking minute working on a creative project (which is certainly not recommended, having a social life is vital to an artist) then there’s always more you could’ve done, and the perfectionist voice will attack you for that.I’ve found the only way to get over the fear of failure has nothing to do with avoiding it and everything to do with embracing it. The only way I can truly feel free as an actor is if I accept the fact that failure is very much a possibility and then genuinely be okay with the idea of falling flat on my face and making a total fool of myself.Now every time I go onstage, I take a moment and say those three words to myself: “Lets go fail” and then I go have fun. The unique thing is, this strategy neither increases nor decreases the probability of failure. What it does change however, is my reaction to it. Now, when I fail, I don’t think of it as a horrible thing, I think of it as what it truly is: an opportunity to become a better artist. It’s only by making failure your friend, that you can ever be fully vulnerable and fully real as an artist.
