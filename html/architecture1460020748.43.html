ARCHITECTURE By The Numbers!©By Gary RudorenYou’re not going to believe this, but you’re an architect. As a matter of fact, you’ve been an architect all your life. That was easy, wasn’t it? If you’ve lived in a house (and really, except for the homeless, pretty much everyone has) then you’ve been an observer and participant in your environment, which is part of the key training that makes architects architects.Architecture is about spatial relationships. I’m sure you already know, based on your having-lived-in-a-house experience, that it’s best to have a Bathroom near your Bedroom in case of late night accidents. The Kitchen should be near the Family Room for easy snack access. The Basement is usually below ground. Etc. See, you know all this.You’ve got even more experience than just residential architecture. If you’ve ever gone into a store or stayed in a hotel or went to the library or even had a job in an office in a skyscraper, then you’ve got experience in retail, hospitality, institutional and high-rise architecture. Your head’s getting a little bigger now I bet.However, at the risk of bursting your bubble, society won’t let you just go around calling yourself an architect.The problem is that a bunch of guys years ago decided that if you want to be a “professional” architect you should have “special” training and go through a rigorous testing process just to earn the “privilege” of being in the selective “fraternity” of people who proudly proclaim at neighborhood progressive dinner parties that they are “Architects” — much to the amazement of other guests who think it’s so cool. These old white guys created a set of “rules” and established “organizations” that regulate the profession and they talked the government into buying into their little scheme to limit your right to call yourself whatever you want (which is Un-American by the way).But now, luckily, you too can declare at any party that you are (although not legally) an architect. You do not need to go to school for 7 years, then intern for 3 years at an architect’s office and finally take a 9-part/36 hour exam just to get an embossed license to hang on your wall. Screw that. The following 8 simple step-by-step steps will help anyone, especially those who lack any talent for creating dynamic spaces or sculpting environments, by giving you the hints, tips, insights and affectations that will convince everyone that you are an architect.Prepare for your ego to be overwhelmed once word spreads that you are a “real architect.”1. Read “The Fountainhead” by Ayn RandLesser guides, with their own shortcuts to becoming an architect, probably will just tell you to read this classic novel about the iconic egoist, “architect” Howard Roark and be done with this whole thing. This book is often cited by architects as having inspired their desire for creative autonomy. (By the way, if you don’t crave creative autonomy, you might want to start doing that). While we believe that reading the book is a good first step to establishing some of your archi-cred, this tome’ has also been widely read by non-architects, so JUST reading it is a bit short-sighted (and remember: you’re trying to be a visionary!). However, incredibly, merely by opening “The Fountainhead” in public, you’ll have set in motion the image of intellectual snobbery that you’ll need as an architect. Those who see you reading it at hipster cafes, on crowded subway cars and at playgrounds where you should be watching your kids will be immediately impressed and curious about your nature. People will want to engage you in discussions of architecture, assuming that you’ve been sucked into Ayn Rand’s black &amp; white world of self-absorbing philosophies. In truth, even if you don’t want to actually be an architect, reading “The Fountainhead” in public quadruples your chances of meeting a hot grad student. If you read it carefully there are life lessons to be learned about the importance of the creative spirit, but like so many of Rand’s two-dimensionally noble characters themselves, people who know you’ve read this book will judge you on the surface as a creative spirit and that’s all you need, baby. Note: I’m not giving away too much from “The Fountainhead” by letting you in on this simple inspirational fact from the book: Protagonist and visionary architect Howard Roark NEVER GRADUATED FROM ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL! Go Ayn, go Ayn.Piece of Trivia To Make You Seem Extra-ArchitectyWhen pronouncing it, remember that “Ayn” Rand’s name rhymes with “Mine” (the first name I mean)If You’d Really Like To Read It But Just Don’t Have The Time For an 800-Page BookHere’s enough about the main characters to get you through a party conversation:Howard Roark (Architect) = Uncompromising, egotistical, design genius, oddly attractive, lanky, “rapist,” and ultimately the hero. Modeled on Frank Lloyd Wright, sorta.Dominique Francon (Femme Fatale) = Sexy, sullen, rich, nuts, faux-intellectual, all-the-men-want-her type, probably not fun to hang out with.Elsworth Toohey (Architectural Critic) = Villain, snooty, master-of-backhanded-compliment, manipulating little fop, wants to rule world.Gale Wynand (Newspaper Publisher) = Incredibly rich, powerful, not-a-big-jokester, controlling, man-of-the-people-who-hates-people.Peter Keating (Architect, Typical) = good friend, always willing to help, best student in his architecture school, not talented in architecture, architect, representative-of-all-that-is-wrong-with-mankind.2. Building… a WardrobeWhile architects don’t have uniforms like police, firemen or stadium vendors, there is a manner of dress that will scream; “Architect!” when you wear it. Your colleagues and potential clients will judge your outside first and try to imagine themselves in various situations where they are standing next to you, so they need to know whether or not what you’re wearing is embarrassing to them. Makes sense doesn’t it? When people envision having a cool home design, they also imagine that it was designed by the coolest person ever. Simply put, this is the impression you need to give through which sweater-vest or zipper-sweater you choose to wear at any given time.The key is to express your individuality, personality, integrity, and overall creative spirit through your wardrobe. History is littered with fashionistas whose ideas have come, been parodied, and then gone. As an architect, a practitioner of a timeless art, you have the responsibility to give the impression that your designs will stand the test of time. Finding the right shoes that say that is a difficult journey, but well worth it. This is a very personal decision, so ultimately, you can’t just understand fashion from looking at a 500-page magazine, BUT, we can help you create your image by giving you an idea of the interpretations that society has pretty much agreed upon for various sartorial elements.The Message you send by wearing a…Blazer says… “I went away to school.”Skinny tie says… “I just finished clubbing and I’m ready for our date.”Neck tattoo says… “I’ve got a past, ask me about it.”Designer sneakers says… “I’m young, vibrant and unconventional.”Rolled Up Sleeve says… “I’m constantly at work and have great forearms”Designer jeans says… “I wear these because I remember a time when these were ironic.”3. Stare at BuildingsRidiculously simple right? Even though you have a lifetime of experience with buildings, there’s always more to see. Stop once in awhile and just look at buildings — their windows, the doors, the colors, the materials. Remember: somebody, somewhere had to pick out those materials and say; “yeah, let’s use these fish-scale shingles, that will be good!” Imagine yourself with that kind of power.4. Pen or Pencil or… Compooter?Everyone’s into computers these days and there’s all this talk about the future of technology, blah, blah, blah. But I say go “old school!” Snap! The simple fact is, the “compooter,” as I like to tauntingly call it, is merely a $1,000 pencil. How do you like that Steve Jobs? You should always have a pen or pencil on you in case a heated discussion on forced perspective comes up in the bar and you need to draw something to prove your bona fides as an architect. Oh, right, I forgot something. This tip is best realized as part of a long-term program where you learn to do hand-sketching. Anyway, it would be tough to carry a comnputer around with you, right… so stick to a good ole’ pen and jar of ink!How To Use This In Your Real LifeEven if you ignore the above advice about learning to sketch architecturally, you can still fall back on the time-honored artistic tradition of doodling (see “Doodling By The Numbers” for more information). Anyone can doodle. A line here, a squiggle there. A cube gone wrong becomes a doodle. You really really can NOT go wrong with a doodle. And no one in their right mind will criticize you for doing a “bad doodle.” Score. Without you even saying it, outsiders will label you as artistic and easily accept you as an architect. That’s just ONE of the benefits of being an epic doodler. For example, if you’re sitting at a bar waiting for your blind eHarmony date, doodle on a bar napkin with the pen you always carry. Your date will be very impressed with your artistic bent and, whether the doodle is good or not, you’re more likely to seem interesting and that could turn into getting a little something something.5. Name Drop, Drop, DroppingThese 8 invaluable steps are an easy guide to becoming an architect, but not necessarily learning everything you need to know about architecture. That might take more steps and could be in a sequel, but for now we are concentrating on creating the image. Part of every architect’s image is their ability to draw upon other artists for inspiration. Therefore you’ll need to bone up on some of the great OTHER artists and architects of the day so you can drop them into conversations where you are determined to be accepted as a real architect.Architects Deemed Popular By The Media (and whose work you can declare you admire)Frank GehryFrank Lloyd WrightLeCorbusierZaha HadidThe guys who did those Bejing Olympics buildings that were cool6. The Importance of An OpinionLet’s face it, if you’re going to declare your ability to transform environments with your mere thoughts, then you can’t be wishy-washy about it. Architects need to say what they say as if to say; “what I say is the way it HAS to be.” Contractors out in the field will stop whatever break they’re taking at the moment to admire your decisiveness. Clients to whom you tell; “You’ll deeply regret not putting an extra laundry room on the 3rd floor” will ultimately respect you for your forcefulness. Even if the opinions you have are nonsensical like; “The roof should be made of ducks” or “You must paint this room blue to surprise the ducks” or “Balance out the limestone flooring in the basement with a pair of ducks” (these examples are all duck-based declarations, but you can substitute your own animal or building material).7. Travel the World — The World!Whatever your non-architecture job is at the moment, it would be great if you could save up all your money to take a big trip. Ideally it’s one of those around-the-world trips. While on the trip, besides telling people you are an architect already (it’s good to practice doing this with foreigners who will believe you — and why shouldn’t they?), you can take this opportunity to expand your mental “image-a-dex” of building designs in other cultures. Some of the things you’ll learn about architecture around the world include:In China, all governmental buildings are oriented towards the sun.In England, there are no offices specifically dedicated to dentistry.In India, roofs are required to be cow-proofed.In Spain, contractors traditionally write their names on all windows in marker that is difficult to clean.In Portugal, contractors traditionally write their names on all windows in marker that is easy to clean.Architects have always had a certain worldliness to them. You’ll need to acquire this someway other than watching travel shows on cable. You need to get the smell of the world in your nose. Architects use ALL their senses when they create! Live life, why don’t you?8. Take A ClassThe first rule for any creative visionary is… there are no rules! I know we said that you DON’T need to go to architecture school to become an architect and we stand by that. But if you live near a home building center (I’m legally not aloud to endorse H-ME DEPO- or others like it) then the best thing you can do is take one of those classes they offer at the store on building stuff. “How To Put In A Kitchen Cabinet in 2 Easy Steps” for example.“Really, do I have to take a class?” — YouArchitects like to get things actually built. Okay, that’s not always true because typically architects draw a lot of designs that never get built, but they save every scrape of paper just in case someone wants to publish their “Unbuilt Works” for some reason. But I think you should be the kind of architect with buildings you can go see and touch… and smell. The best way to do that is to get buddy buddy with guys that do the real work — the contractors (you might want to take some time right now and go look up “Contracting By The Numbers” and familiarize yourself with that before reading on).Okay, back to these home center classes. You’ll get a lot of respect from Joe Lunchbox if, when talking to him on the job site, you’re able to reference some fancy name for a tool, or a technique you learned at some H-ME DEPO- “Tile Seminar.” Joe would love you and respect you and not think you’re just some “pansy-ass in a zipper-sweater.” He (or Jane Lunchbox, let’s be modern) will then work harder to accomplish your vision because of your down-to-earthliness. Win/win!Well, there you go fellow “Architects”! Follow these simple steps and in almost no time you’ll be popular OR, even better, controversial!ARCHITECTURE BY THE NUMBERS has purposefully taken this opportunity to give you the valuable advice you’ll need to be an architect in your eyes and the eyes of those whom you want to believe you when you tell them you’re an architect. We have purposefully not directed a lot of information about the field, the history, engineering, and the philosophy of the art of architecture because there are already a lot of books on that stuff.
