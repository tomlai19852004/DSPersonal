79 Social Media Facts You Need To KnowSocial media is an addiction.Well, it is for many of us. Most people can’t walk straight these days as they have their head in the mobile phone and one eye on the pavement. If someone from 100 years ago was transported to 2016, they would think we were mad as we talk to ourselves with white wires hanging from our ears!So why are we so captivated?It’s about human connection at scale that networks us to billions of people. We are curious about the impact of our creations. Will they like it? Are they sharing my thoughts, photos and videos?It also gives us a voice.Social media makes us feel empoweredThis intersection of humanity and technology is human super consciousness enabled by hardware, apps and wireless connectivity to world wide networks. It is an extension and augmentation of our reach and influence.This global mind meld allows us to share thoughts, feelings and images with our family and friends no matter where we or they are. It allows us to scale our reach as we share on our smartphones to a waiting world.Virtual reality is becoming the reality. Social media is now a big part of that reality.We can also join in global engagement of our individual interests. A niche interest in playing a certain online game, sharing, train watching ideas and cave diving tips can now be indulged with other like minded humans that become our global interest tribes. You no longer have to drive or fly to join or create a conversation. Skype, Periscope, Blab or WhatsApp can help you connect from home.It’s hyper connectivity at scale.

These include:Flipboard: Over 70 million usersWhatsApp: Just cracked the 1 billion user markSnapchat: Reported to have 100 million usersSocial media is splintering. It’s no longer just about Facebook.So the social sharing buttons need to be updated. I have now added Flipboard and WhatsApp. To help me do that I use one of the best Apps for bloggers and website owners.. (an awesome app called SumoMe).It allows me to easily connect and update my sharing buttons (plus 11+ other cool options) which can be a floating sidebar, at the top or sitting at the bottom of the page.Not only that but it provides you with great metrics and stats.

A fad that would pass. It was reported that Facebook offered $3 billion to buy the company and everyone thought they were mad to reject it.But the facts in 2016 show a different story.100 million active daily users18% of all social media users in the USA use Snapchat30% of all US. millennials use the network8,796 photos a second are shared on SnapchatSnapchat is reputed to have 5% of the overall selfie marketStatistics source: Expanded RamblingsInfographic source: GrowingsocialmediaWhatsApp factsThis story behind the brand name was a play on words of “What’s Up”. Facebook bought it for $19 billion on Valentine’s Day, 2014 after beating Google’s offer of $10 billion.It’s core philosophy is simplicity.This is a little different to how Google approached the concept with Google+.

Google+ Hangouts. Google+ has even admitted that Google+ maybe split up into its functional parts.Maybe the problem was that it tried to do too much rather than start simple and evolve. Cases to prove that simple works include Twitter, Snapchat and WhatsApp.It’s big bang theory that imploded after investing over half a billion in it’s design and development. Deep pockets don’t always win.Google won at search but not social.Despite that here are some figures I managed to dig up.There are 2.2 billion G+ profilesOnly 9% have any publicly posted content. Do the math. That’s 198 million that published!37% mentioned that those activities were comments on YouTube videosStatas source: SocialscoremediaInstagram factsInstagram has now passed Twitter in the user count and it looks like it is Facebook’s best investment.
