What’s next for social media?2014 was a big year for social media. Ad dollars moved fast, Facebook’s stock jumped 42.6 percent, Instagram and Twitter became businesses, Snapchat exploded. In 2015, the business of social media will continue to evolve rapidly. Here’s what’s next…Messaging apps will become the way people subscribe to communications from businesses. Advertisers will pay to reach their messaging app subscribers with targeted messages, just like they do with email or SMS blasts. In the west, Messenger will become the leading messaging platform for brands due to its scale, resources, leadership, and data. In the east, WeChat will flourish as it continues to integrate advertising, content, commerce and literally everything else; Line will follow in its footsteps. And Snapchat will further blossom, spiking again with the launch of its Discover feed.The new buzz word for messaging is platformization. As these apps establish themselves as the primary means of subscription distribution, they have the opportunity to become full-scale platforms, inclusive of media and transactions. All signs point to the opportunity becoming a reality.The question for messaging becomes: what happens after you opt-in to receive communications from all of your favorite people, publishers and businesses? Do messaging apps become overwhelming, like email and Twitter? We will need algorithms for messaging, and Facebook does algorithms best.Commerce is being integrated into social feeds and messaging apps. Similar to publishers, brands will be forced to sell not only on their own websites, but third-party social platforms where people spend their time. It’s an easier decision for brands than publishers, however, because a) they’ve been working with retail partners forever and b) they will still fulfill the order and thus own all customer data. Owning the data is key.There is a high volume of referral traffic going from mobile-social to e-commerce websites. However, this traffic has relatively low conversion rates because the UX is poor. A Buy button solves this problem for users and brands. Why create several extra steps—bad barriers—when someone can just click and buy in the feed? Twitter’s already integrated commerce and the tech is flawless (see: @TwitterCommerce). Facebook is currently testing a Buy button in news feed (for brands) and Groups (for p2p commerce); I suspect we will see personalized e-commerce carousel units, with the products you care most about, in news feed and on Pages by end of year.Mobile commerce is going to become a lot easier for users in in 2015.Video is becoming the dominant type of social content. From a recent Laundry Service study based on 100M impressions served by 20 brands, videos on Facebook now achieve 2x more reach and 2x more engagement than photo and link posts. And yes, Facebook has become as big a video platform as YouTube… but the bigger point is that Facebook and YouTube and Snapchat (and Netflix) are the future of video distribution.Time spent on mobile has surpassed TV. TV ratings and ad sales have never been worse, and will continue to decline. Meanwhile, digital video is the fastest growing ad format and will continue to be through 2017. You can do the math.Zuck says he expects videos to be the only content on Facebook within five years. And if it continues to create standalone apps for its most popular features — messaging, photos (Instagram), groups—Facebook’s got a video app in the works, too. The video app would replace channel surfing on TV, bringing you all of the best streaming content in a lean-back experience. Whether it’s organizing friends, news, entertainment, messaging or shopping—Facebook’s algorithm will continue to be its defining technological achievement, providing value to users and advertisers on all screens, across content and commerce, which drive the business of the Internet.Finally, the Oculus consumer headset is supposed to be released in 2015. Do not overlook this. If the consumer product that ships is as amazing as the demos, Oculus will be a bigger steal than Instagram. There are many technological hurdles ahead of virtual reality, so delays would not surprise me, but it remains extremely exciting as it is Facebook’s first chance to own the operating system… for what could be the next big video medium.So yeah… messaging, commerce, video. 2015.
