How to Start an App alongside a 9 hour day job, Family, Social Life and not lose your mind in the process.It all started drunk, as many of my best ideas do. Only this time instead of ending up passed out somewhere, I had a brilliant idea for an app.My friends and I were spending our last few hours in Ibiza soaking up the sun and drinking Cava Sangria. In my relaxed and bubbly state I overheard my friends talking. “Send me a drop box link when we are back in London, ok?”, “yeah sure, you send me one as well with all your photos”. Thus the start of my Itch. The itch is this feeling I had which told me I would not be able to stop bothering about this idea until it was completed.I realised my friends method of exchanging photos was inefficient. Imagine if there were 20 of us… that’s 19 links you’ll receive…. 19 people you would have to chase for those links…. And If they were friends of friends…. 19 people you would have to connect with either on Facebook, WhatsApp or via email address etc….So I did my research and nothing worthy is out there to fix this issue. Forgive the brief plug………. My apps called Groupr. It connects people into private groups for simultaneous photo and message sharing without the needed to actually interconnect with them via social media, emails, phone numbers etc etc. So go download it (IOS &amp; Android).(Links; IOS: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/groupr-app/id1054418798 . Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redouane.groupr)Plug over.This article, after all, is about my journey, not my app.Stage 1: The PlanI could not stop speaking about this great Idea that hit me. I was due for one.. It had been a couple of years since I last had one. On the flight back I formulated a plan of action in my head that consisted of 1) design app 2) make app 3) launch app. After all, it’s just an app. Thousands have done it, why can’t I ?!?!. After a couple of days of settling back into my job (I work in the Investment industry) I realised it was now time to get it done!I wrote down what I wanted the app to do and expanded on that idea, drew it out, made a business plan. The design, development, launch would come next! Easy right? Wrong. It’s a hard, lonely journey that can only be taken alone. The itch after all cannot be transferred. You may get a business partner as I did, but they’ll never have the itch. They’ll be excited and behind it 100%. But the itch is for one. That’s it. You may think otherwise. You’re wrong. By all means you’ll have a great team, who are 100% dedicated etc, but the Itch is reserved for one. Your passion and success will come from overcoming this itch. Their passion will come from making it a success. Or something like that. Whatever.So I sat down and I put pen to pad. My app concept was not yet an idea. It was just a thought. I made my first horrible attempt at a business plan. But what it did do was allow me to write it ALL down… from competitors, to demographic of my customers and everything in between. This took a couple of weeks as I had to do research and to be honest I wasn't 100% sure of what I was doing.Stage 2: Implementation and everything elseHaving had the business plan completed, I now thought it would be great to make a basic prototype using the many free apps out there that allow you to do so. I do NOT want to talk about this; I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to use the applications, making/designing pages for Groupr and other nonsense. Don’t do this at this stage. Please don’t. It’s not the time for it and to be honest it would never be the right time for me and I never used it again. Like all great tools, it’s for some not all.“The fear of realising I've gone slightly crazy as I explain the method to my madness is not worth it and may hold me back.”For some weird and wacky reason, I thought I was ready for VC’s. I wasn't mind you, but I thought I was. So I called them up, sent them emails with my business plan and my prototype etc etc. Needless to say I was ignored by most, and some were nice enough to tell me I was doing it all wrong.So I listened and took in the feedback. They were right. I have invested ZERO into this… why should they! So, obviously, I needed to do this right. (Side Note: there may be some words of wisdom here, feel free to ask me questions as well, but honestly, I just feel like I need to rant)At this point, it should be known that I am fully committed. After working 8–10 hours with my day job I go to a coffee shop and work roughly 2–3 hours every week night. On weekends, I average roughly 4–6 hours each weekend day. Given it was still early days, I was fine with this level of commitment, and still thought I could juggle it around family time, friend time, gym time and girlfriend time. By the way, 6 hours of sleep is PLENTY! This is coming from a guy that needs at least 8. But don’t worry, soon enough you’ll realise 6 is pretty damn good.I can’t work just anywhere as I get distracted. It’s London; pretty girls, flashing lights and noises are everywhere. So I went to the Costa Coffee off Bond Street Station. This was perfect, it has a basement seating area… no windows and it was moderately comfortable. I couldn't see whether it was raining or sunny and it enforced a level of commitment in me. I was here, I have my laptop, and I won’t leave this place until I get whet I had planned to do done. Depressing to say the least. But god damn it, I wanted this and I will see it through to the very end and to whatever end. Listen guys, you are either in it or you’re not. You want it or you don’t. It’s not easy, some do get lucky, but most of us normal guys have to juggle full time job, personal commitments and build an app. Your friends and family pity you, but make them stay out of the way. If you don’t understand, don’t try to. The fear of realising I've gone slightly crazy as I explain the method to my madness is not worth it and may hold me back.By the way, there’s no method to this madness. As I said, it’s a half rant, half journey telling, badly written, unstructured jumble of somewhat cohesive text. For example, as I'm writing this, I'm getting a little anxious and angry. Why? Well fuck it, why not. I might as well be. I have put money I didn't have, time I couldn't spare and effort I did not know I had into this thing. IT’S NOT EASY. People make it worse by trying to cause more stress than they are worth. They question your every move and how you spend way too much time on something that doesn't even make any money for you and that you should spend that time instead with girlfriends/friends/gym etc.So for all you readers that can relate in one way or another; ignore them. It’s not worth it. I was told by one of my confidants who is a moderately (or was) successful entrepreneur. That struggled more than I have and built his art empire before selling it for seven figures after a couple of years. He told me that it’s a very, very lonely road. Friends and loved ones will drop in and out. They will NEVER get you…. they’ll never understand the itch. But that’s ok… as they are there to support you. If they don’t support you then quite frankly you are better off without them and they can rightly fuck off.I had my wire-frame done, I had a great designer who I will mention by name: Laith Wallace (http://www.laithwallace.com/) I mean seriously, this guy just got me. We sat down for a meeting. He wanted to get inside my head, understand my journey, hear my emotion and visualise my story. The first, very first draft he had.. was exactly what I wanted. It’s quite hard explaining how your design should be… but he knew…. The logo was spot on first try.The design for the app was spot on first try. Every single person I have shown the app to loves the UI. It is great. He is very skilled and his prices are competitive. Use him if you want. I’m happy to introduce him to anyone.With the design done, I used a prototype making website to make an app on my phone. All it would do would link the relevant pages together. Nothing special. But it gave me an idea of how I wanted it to work. How each page linked you to another page. On the back of this I did make a few small changes as I noticed that the user experience was a little off in a couple sections. That’s why it’s important to do it. So do it.I should mention I have a business partner who owns a minority stake of Groupr. He also owns his own IT services company and we met as his company provides IT services etc to a hedge fund I worked at. His name is T.Now T is a great guy, very knowledgeable and extremely professional and personable. Enough about him. He’s married and it feels like I'm writing his Tinder profile. But if you aren't technical, it would be wise to bring someone who is in. I was due for a trip to Thailand (I have LOADS of stories about this, if I get enough people asking ill happily write my experience there) for two weeks with my friend. Just two guys who needed a break from London and the cold. T was tasked with gathering proposals for developers and to have a few waiting for my review when I got back.“The art is in the struggle and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”There’s a lot of Developers out there. Some in London quoted up to £75,000+. Yeah right. I had little to spend. And I found a great company in India to do it for a very competitive price (mind you they did both native IOS and Android apps). (http://www.mavinapps.com/ ). I received a lot of bullshit proposal’s and had many bullshit calls with many bullshit companies who all said they can do it. But it never felt right and they always seemed to be saying YES to everything. Mavin on the other hand was different. These guys questioned everything. They recommended and they got technical and showed they fully understood what I wanted. It was a perfect fit. They are really good guys, seriously. I still use them to this day. You don’t have to use them.. but be wary… There are a lot of yes men as competition is high in India, with a very talented workforce. So if you are not physically there, careful of the people who take on. (Depending on how many people ask, I'm happy to go into detail on how and why I rejected and accepted those to work with whilst outsourcing)This period. This damn period. Is the worst. It’s long (like 4–6 months) and tiresome. Every two weeks I would receive a build from the developers. In these two weeks I would test every single aspect of the app. EVERYTHING. Again and again every two weeks. Bugs are inevitable… they are everywhere… and they can be hidden in the weirdest forms…and triggered only by certain actions… god damn them! Seriously, they caused a lot of my stress. Even when they are found, they can pop up again! But yes, it’s now over. I can relax. Yeah right..My life went to pause mode. I had no money as I had to pay for the app and every time I went for drinks I would have two things to think about: a) This money would be better of being invested in marketing and b) I can’t afford to be hungover, I need to wake up at 8 am on Saturday and work for 6 hours.Friends, family and females got annoying. Family and friends were supportive. They understood what I was going through and allowed me to talk my heart out and rant and even provided insightful feedback.I'm not really sure where I am going with this… I'm just ranting. The key thing here is to keep your head above water. You know what you want. People will tell you you’re doing it wrong, they will say you are crazy and you don’t have a chance. That may all be true. But, you obviously have the balls to do it. Not many people have that. True entrepreneurial spirit is lost amongst those whose parents open up a shop for them and they call themselves self-made businesspeople. Whatever. The art is in the struggle and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I have learnt loads and am a better man for it regardless of my app making it or not. It’s a long, lonely journey of which I am only a fraction into…. I have now launched and quite frankly I'm broke and I'm scared. Two things, two very big things that are essential to success. No money and nothing more to lose.My friend told me something many years ago that has probably kept me going in this part of my life. He told me that the only way to succeed was to get uncomfortable. He was right. Whenever I felt like stopping, and going for a drink or meeting my friends etc. I told myself… what if I didn't have those options… I want this app…. I really wanted it. No, I needed it. My life was becoming too corporate and it was now or never. Its either I leave the comfort of my life and aim for better or I stick with my day job. I got uncomfortable when I worked. This made me want to work harder and to get it over and done with. It also made me work smarter as I didn't want all of this to be in vain.So get uncomfortable. It makes you work harder. You see all these guys that have made something from nothing. They were not comfortable. They had no other option… it was this or absolutely nothing… You need the right mind frame; you need to believe that this is all or nothing… I look around me… I work for a great company, have an above average salary and have a great group of friends and live in London. But I knew I didn't want to work… not for someone else, I wanted financial freedom and I want to work for myself. It’s tough, there are ups and down and there are a lot of other unique issues you’ll face. It’s worth it.So apologies for this long rant again. It’s badly written with no real sense of direction or any real point. I don’t even think I stuck with what the subject says. But if you read it, it’s because you want to go at it alone and do your own thing. Take the risk and do it. Win or lose. It’s never failure if you have learnt something. Pick yourself up. On to the next one.I should mention something called loyalty. I do not mix my day job with my app. My job pays me to do what they have paid me to do. So when I'm here I'm committed to being here. When I'm at home or after work etc I can do whatever I like and that’s when I sacrifice my own personal time for the app. Do NOT sacrifice work time for your app. Its not fair and its bad form. You wouldn't want your future employees to do it so you shouldn't.Get uncomfortable. Get it done.My apps on the Google Play store and IOS App store. It’s called Groupr. It’s a unique trouble free way to share photos and its great.Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or if you want me to expand on any of the above. I’ll be happy to help. I'm still meeting a lot of people. Networking is key. Don’t forget them. In fact, I have a lot more to say about the apps journey rather than my own. Here’s the deal, ill share full insight into my talks with VC’s, Networking and all my negotiations etc If enough people read and share this. After all, I don’t really want to write this with nobody reading. Sharing is caring…. Especially if it’s done on Groupr :)
