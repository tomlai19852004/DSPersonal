My Pledge: Action over ignoranceDespite these difficulties, I know the kind of researcher I want to be. I accept and relish that I do not have complete control over my research process. It means compromise, and it means being wrong.I want to be aware of the social systems around teaching and learning in the real world. I do not want to ignore any individual or group. I want to work with teachers and students. I want my writing and speech to reach those who need and want it, and want them to understand what I’m saying. I want to escape the ivory tower. I want to change the way teachers teach and students learn. I want to change the way we see and define education in general, and science education in specific.At the end of the day — teachers need to have greater access to education research as a process as well as its implications. I am extremely grateful for my background in environmental science — for showing me the need for evidence based approaches, and how to implement these findings in the real, complex, hard-working world.This means not thrusting a bunch of articles at teachers and expecting something out the end, something other than resentment. It’s about delivering education, ideas, conversation, and thought in such a way that teachers can not only access, but also utilise them. This means being able to understand and then put it into practice. Personally I see it as my ultimate goal to make this as easy as possible for teachers and educators.This doesn’t mean doing everything for them, it means making teachers want it, and then enabling them to get it. The specifics of this goal will likely concern the rest of my research career, which may or may not include my natural life.Not aloneI won’t even pretend I’m the first person to realise this problem and do something about it. This approach can broadly be classified as Participatory Action Research — a methodology popularised in chemistry education at least, by Ingo Eilks — a German chemical education researcher who structures a lot of his research in consultation process with teachers and educators. The approach is receiving traction, with relevant work coming out more frequently.This is a promising time for education researchers and teachers and I’m legitimately proud to say that I am part of it.This is definitely a journey, and not one that I intend to do alone.
