Lately I am fascinated by works such as Roman philosopher Seneca’s On the Shortness of Life that shows how nothing much has changed in 2000 years. The Epic of Gilgamesh dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (circa 2100 BC) describes a culture with emotions expressed so much more freely than ours.It is fascinating to read “voices” that communicate so clearly over time.What is something small or seemingly insignificant that contributes greatly to your happiness?A smile makes the world a friendlier place.Tell us about a memorable gift you’ve given or received.I was sitting with my 3 year old son when he asked “Why are we here?” I knew what he meant, but I shied away from the answer, and asked if he meant why we are in this room.No, again he asked “Why are we here?” I answered truthfully and said that I did not know. He thought a bit and said “I think it is for love”. I told him that I think he is right.What a beautiful philosophical gift, I will treasure it always.What is a regret you have that others could learn from?If I do have a regret it is that I was far too hard on myself when I was younger. As I grow older I understand that it is essential to have compassion for yourself and others. Sometimes my best intentions can go wrong and things that I consider to be negative may have a positive effect in the long run. Life is too complex, you cannot foresee the effects of your actions, you can only control the intention of the action.Tell us about a travel experience or destination that you would recommend to others.Anywhere new and strange opens up one’s mind to ideas, and destroys preconceptions. Europe when I was 16, and our teacher left us to our own devices. The colours of India!
