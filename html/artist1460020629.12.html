This also allowed me to meet and learn from many incredibly brilliant creatives. These chance meetings would never have happened if I just remained within the “artist” box that creatives are too often placed into. Everything became a beautiful challenge.To this day still I love problem-solving and art with all my heart. I‘ve written all of this to say that it’s OKAY if you don’t feel like an artist in the traditional sense at the beginning of your career or ever. It’s ok if you don’t fit the pre-existing mold for your specific career. Break it. Create outside of your comfort zone. As humans ( and especially creatives), we are not meant to be categorized and put into a one size fits all box.We are all living a unique human experience which should be expressed in different ways. Focus more on what you truly enjoy. Absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can, practice every day for several hours — no matter what your discipline is, the medium and answer will eventually find you.Cheers!If you would like to check out more of my work you can visit me on Dribbble.
