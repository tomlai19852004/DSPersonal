In SummaryUsing @extend has issues but we can avoid them by structuring our classes to do very specific jobs and using mixins to DRY up our CSS.I’m new to ReactJS and currently I haven’t been convinced that its approach will be adopted by other frameworks or platforms so for now having a strong CSS architecture is still a great advantage. Maybe less so if you’ve adopted ReactJS however.
