It’s been ten years since Emporia State last reviewed and revised its professional development school model. The school has set up a redesign committee to study what changes the program will need to make to keep up with new challenges in education. Graduates from the school are heading into classrooms that are more diverse than ever, in a turbulent political environment that — both in Kansas and around the country — threatens big changes in education funding, teacher employment protections, and student evaluations.Making things more difficult, a third of Emporia State’s teacher college faculty plan to retire in the next five years, taking with them decades of experience. “We will have to get the new faculty acclimated to the professional development school model,” said Seimears, appearing anxious about the prospect. He paused and added, “We need to seek diversity.”Recruiting diverse faculty and students has proven difficult at Emporia State. I sat in on the school’s reading teaching methods class, and while the students were working on small-group exercises, I asked the professor if the skewed demographics of the class — I counted twenty women and only one man — were common at the teacher’s college. “Yes,” she said, “and you notice they’re all white.” She said there were a few more men in her class the previous semester, but the vast majority of teacher candidates continue to be white women.Nationally, the demographic gap between teachers and students in the United States is stark: Seventy-five percent of public school teachers are women, and 82 percent are white, while nearly half of public school students are kids of color. With recruitment efforts failing to attract significantly diverse teacher candidates, schools like Emporia State are developing curricula that prepare graduates to teach students across the demographic divide.Jill Jones, an instructor at Emporia, has written a book with her colleagues on how to teach science to elementary students who do not speak English as a first language. The book grew out of a seminar that Jones and her colleagues teach to Emporia State students each semester, part of a broader curriculum the school has developed to prepare teachers for diverse student populations.“The Hispanic families at our schools [where we used to teach] were very trusting of us,” Jones said. “They would listen, ask a couple of questions for clarification, but then explain that we were the experts and whatever we decided, they would support.”Heiman, the second grade teacher, said Emporia State’s diversity curriculum was a reason why he chose to teach at his current school, the poorest and most diverse in the district, over a job offer at the second richest school in the district. Megan Cronk, currently a junior at Emporia State, similarly said she feels her coursework has prepared her to student-teach next year at a school in Wichita with many English language learners. “I’m excited for it, to practice how to teach students from different cultures,” Cronk said.Looking ahead, Cronk admits she’s a little anxious about her first year in the classroom. “They say in your first year of teaching, you learn more than your whole time in college,” she said. But she’s also excited to finally have the job she wants, with plenty of guidance and mentorship for when she makes the inevitable mistake.When I asked if she plans to stay in teaching for her entire career, she nodded and gave a little shrug. “I haven’t dropped out yet.”Illustrations by Gracia LamBright is made possible by funding from the New Venture Fund, and is supported by The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
