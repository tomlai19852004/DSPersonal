While the data gathered by these five teachers doesn’t constitute a scientific study, this small sample size — and the discussion it inspired — reveals important insights about how great teachers spend their time. We hope these findings spark a much-needed debate about the daily work of teaching, and how school systems can do more to support a sustainable teaching profession.Do these numbers surprise you? How can schools find ways to make sure their best teachers have more time to devote to the activities they feel achieve the best results for kids? Should teachers be spending more time delivering instruction — or less? Who else on a school team could relieve teachers of tasks that don’t have a direct influence on student achievement?
