Alex Haw: On Extraordinary Design, Latitudinal Cuisines, and the State of London ArchitectureAlex Haw, Photo by Susanna Porter ÖhmanI caught up with Alex Haw of award-winning architectural practice Atmos Studio for a chat about how they conjure magic out of constraints, thoughts on London architecture in general, and his very conceptual dinner parties. Atmos’ innovative architectural work has centered around creating organic and sculptural spaces for residential designs, often incorporating cutting-edge digital technologies.Atmos is a unique architectural practice that seems to sit comfortably on the border of art, architecture and technology. How did it all begin?It began without really any true financial seed, apart from my teaching. I had been working at various companies, quite pragmatic functional ones like Grimshaws or Rogers or Seth Stein, and increasingly started teaching. Teaching is a way that enables you to explore much more difficult to enact ideas, and one of the problems I was having is that I was asking the students to do stuff that I wasn’t really doing myself because I was working in fairly conventional practices. So I felt a huge degree of hypocrisy.We were doing quite difficult things. When I began teaching, I was teaching a first year course at the Architectural Association and I was suggesting that video was an act of drawing. And that really they should learn to video before they learn to draw in order to learn how light moves through space and how atmospheres are created. I was co-teaching with a sound artist, and it was quite radical stuff. And there I was doing less radical stuff in practice, so I felt the moral obligation to test a little bit what I was teaching and to give myself the chance to deploy it.At first I didn’t have any clients, and I didn’t know how I was going to get any. Did a few competitions, did lots of pitches to people to do their houses, knew I wasn’t going to get an airport very quickly. So we got a residential house, and then another one and so on.I think, sensibility-wise, the thrust from our work arises from a combination of analysis and intuition. From an intuition that this sort of stuff has a place in the world and needs to be done, but also an analysis of the constraints of any given situation or project or requirement, even if it’s artistic. And how that will then get sold, or built, or lived, or experienced. It’s a marriage of Dionysis and Apollo I hope, a little bit. Does that make any sense?Yeah, definitely. I definitely felt in design school that you’re pushed to do conceptual, unrealistic projects then work in the real world is… very different. A harsh reality. So would you say that with Atmos you’re able to cut through reality? Haha.Would be so lovely if that was the case. When you’re still in design school you’re trying quite extraordinary things, some of which are …useful, and some of which are less so. I find it a little bit upsetting sometimes because sometimes design school work can just be quite dumb; quite naive. And other times it’s upsetting to be in practice because you feel the constraints of conventionality and certainly a budget. That’s really one of the biggest things that you just don’t touch on in design school, because nothing costs anything.You describe the work that you do as ‘bespoke sculptural environments’. How do you begin your projects? What’s the first step?It’s always quite anal. And it’s always in a funny way, quite boring. And it’s very analytical. It always starts with the site, the context. Trying to understand exactly what’s going on geometrically, light-wise, sun-wise, how people are flowing across it. It starts to try and understand what the body needs to do. Ergonomics is a huge huge factor. It’s often about trying to innovate some kind of position of ergonomics that wasn’t previously seen as possible.The relationship of bodies is a huge thing. But our work starts in a very mathematical, diagrammatic, analytical way. It always begins with trying to find the exact constraints; to source the basic genetic code to the project, which then starts developing and aggregating complexity, adding information, and building up. The curves come later — projects are always uncurved at the beginning. They always start with just blocking out. The difference I would say between our process and, for example, Frank Gehry’s, is that a lot of his underlying programmatic massing is actually quite basic; ultimately quite un-analytical. It’s quite simplistic, it’s quite unprecise. The eventual, inevitable wrapping of all those programmatic boxes then has nothing much to do with that. He gesturally covers it all in scrunched paper, in a kind of blobby way, and it’s great but very subjective and intuitive, and actually quite violent — and quite shocking.What do you think are the most important factors that contribute to your designs?I think it’s interesting because to me it seems quite clear. We don’t just look at something, and we don’t just think about something and then pop out a design; we’re constantly researching a project, even through to the end of its design. Constantly analyzing the site, processing it; creating information from it. It’s sort of like growing — growing something out of constraints and context that feels right. And part of you always has to step away from the desk and come back and see — is that working?Because you’re getting close to the solution and you come back and go, hm that’s not really working. So there’s always this sensitivity there that’s not purely robotic or algorithmic. Which is about does it work, does it feel right? Would my mother approve? Would anyone off the street feel like that works? Does that make sense?Yes, so it’s a very organic process it sounds like.Yeah there’s definitely a kind of regimented way of doing it. Each time there are different requirements but there’s a general analytical iterative process. Testing, combining, a real jigsaw puzzle thing about what goes where, shifting things around continuously, and blending, morphing all of that.You’ve referred to ‘the architect as psychologist’, which I thought was really interesting. So how do you make design decisions based on what your clients are telling you?I’m always trying to get into their head. To uncover not just their prejudices, but what their need is. What their actual inner core is. In fact one thing I’ve been thinking about a lot is actually slightly innovating a different interrogative process. And that’s spending a day with the residential clients, in the background, without conversing; just seeing how do they use the space and making notes. We’ve never done that, it’d be really time consuming — but it would be invaluable.I find one thing with architect’s designs is, quite often, they’re a very conventional series of elements — the floor, the walls, the ceiling — and then there’s only a kind of innovation of one of those junctions: maybe the shadow gap or the knuckle joints on the column, or that kind of thing. And I find with our work it’s often about every corner, and every detail is very bespoke.Because that is the actual experience of your life, if you’re living in a building. You’re moving through corners, you’re moving through surfaces, you’re moving between spaces, between situations and environments.And so we interrogate our clients about every one of those situations. What time do you wake up? What time does he wake up? How do you get dressed vs. him? Do you turn the light on? Do you not? Does it bother you the noise of his belt buckle scraping? When he takes a shower do you hear the water? When you brush your teeth does one of you look into the mirror and the other doesn’t? Would you prefer the daylight of a window pouring into the sink in front of you instead? It’s just trying to envisage in a really real way, like a film director, the exact drama of their life.Thinking about how can that be enhanced, and how can that be made better. I’m particularly talking about the residential projects here.Roominaroom seemed to get a lot of critical acclaim. Do you think that’s the project that has been the most publicised?The project that I think has gotten the most critical acclaim is the Clapham House and particularly the stair. And what’s weird is that the house has got loads of stuff in it that’s cool which is slightly overshadowed by the stair and honestly, I know it sounds wrong, but I can’t quite figure out why. If you look for that image it’s everywhere, all over the web. Everyone’s like, ‘Oh the melty stair, wouldn’t want to come down that drunk.’ So funny. But that’s the first time we implemented CNC technology, and was in a way one of the most basic things we’ve done — and the precedent for Roominaroom.‘Sensualscaping’ Clapham House, Alex Haw, Atmos StudioFor both of these projects it was about achieving quite a lot for very little budget. That stair cost £8,000, so that innovation was using the technology in quite a simple way to achieve maximum effect. It’s just a box that project. It’s a stairs of planar panels that are meeting at 90 degrees for simplicity — with a radial grid of risers to allow you the sense of flow as you go up. Because we’ve got a radial grid we’ve then got weird cuts in the side walls to accept these planar elements that are coming in. With the kind of 3-axis low-cost CNC-router technology we were using, there are usually major constraints in the way you can cut panels, and that difficulty requires us to start adding layers to cover it up, like a series of skirting boards. Those layers we then start to tease out as threads that then multifunction as balustrades, to meet the stair regulations in Britain.Regulations, and the constraints of our fairly-simplistic digifab construction technique, both actually become fertile ground for creating something quite complex. All we’re doing, and everyone thinks it’s bent wood but it’s not, is just making a series of curves meet each other at tangents. A curve in a horizontal plane meeting a curve in a vertical plane. That’s it.So it’s about finding creativity in restrictions.Absolutely, that’s really important. That’s a huge part of architecture, in a way: that it’s not art. I feel quite uncomfortable with pure art because it has so little restriction. It has a certain indulgence and it’s not subject to other constraints.Regarding that particular stair, I remember a guy coming in to judge it for an award, and it’s a guy who specializes in timber engineering and he couldn’t figure out how it was made, yet it was made really simply. It was made out of three planes coming together — but it looked like a complex object. And that was really brilliant — that he had been so deceived.The project that I discovered in the book Digital Handmade — ‘Worldscape’ — how did that project come about?Well, there are two backgrounds to that. Number one, when you work your ass off you need to find something that is going to make sure you’re not going to work your ass off all the time. So quite early on I started this dinner club. There was the added benefit that, when you work in a small group of people, where you’re not going to meet your social life through work — you need another outlet. So I started this dining club called Latitudinal Cuisine, which is very much a representation of the complexity of Britain’s multiculturalism, the post-Colonial bounty we have.Worldscape, Alex Haw, Atmos StudioAt the time, I was learning to cook slowly, I’m not a good cook — I certainly was a terrible cook then. But I didn’t have time to cook 15 meals for 15 people, and all the shopping and wash up afterwards. Nor did I have the money — I couldn’t afford to keep spending all this money on all of these dinners for people, but I wanted to get people together. So the simple idea was, everyone bring a dish, and you’d bring a dish from the latitudinal line matching the day of the year. There’s the latitudinal theory of cuisine — like the fact that chocolate only grows between -/+10 around the Equator, and you get your wine lines, and rice lines, and grain lines, etc; the theory that certain cultures eat in certain ways because of the geographic latitude they’re on; that social culture comes from physical context.The wonderful thing about it is that the people that come are generous, open-minded, explorative people that you just want to have in your life. They’re doing something scary, bringing something generous and innovative to a group full of strangers they don’t (yet) know; it’s amazing. And it’s been a complete revision of my whole life. All of these incredible people week by week pour into my life.Everyone comes from all kinds of walks of life. But what’s amazing is that at no cost you can just invite anyone you want and we do it in all kinds of different houses so there’s layers of exploration because we go throughout the city and whoever wants to host will host. We had one for 200 in the street this summer; otherwise they’re mostly 12, 16, 20, 30 people. We meet all kinds of foods, we meet all kinds of cultures, all kinds of people. It’s a bit of an incredible phenomenon. So it’s just a joy to be a part of.The 2nd background is that for the Olympics, I did a bid with a guy called Carlo Ratti. He’s a friend of mine that I collaborate with a fair bit. He gets bigger projects and has a bigger resource to draw on. He’s a professor at MIT, runs a practice in Italy and has quite a lot of funding. So he got commissioned to do a pitch to Boris Johnson for a big centerpiece for the London Olympics, for which Boris wanted the monument for the 21st century — the Eiffel tower of the 21st century. And we went into a whole bunch of meetings and said you know the Eiffel tower is not a great idea, the age of steel is over, it’s about Code, not Carbon. And they said — you know this is being sponsored by a steel magnate? So there went our idea. Haha.So I thought, why don’t we do something with the Latitudinal cuisines. We’ve got all of the world coming here for the Olympics, but the thing with London is that all of the world is here already. We wanted to show off the non-Englishness of London so we decided to do something where over the course of 20 days of the Olympics we chose to highlight global cuisines. We chose three European areas, three African areas, Asian, American, and so on. Every night we did a different slice of that local cuisine, so just little micro-glimpses into the worldliness of London.And we did it all around that massive table. What we were doing there is that we were taking a data set and making it habitable. You eat on top of the coastline, you sit in the ocean trench, the first level at which all of the continents are finally united together because of course ultimately, the world is one. So that determined the scale, so the highest point in the world which is 9 km would be 2 meters high. And into that surface we marked different bits of information about the world. For the megacities we put lights in to show the level of population as seen by satellite, so in other words light pollution, which is a sort of human layer to that map. And everyone is encouraged to explore the world that gets mapped in lots of different ways.It had to be quick fit system because we had absolutely no time to do it, we started the project in the end of May and it had to be built by mid-July and when we started we didn’t have any backers or funders or venue or chefs. It’s pretty crazy what you can achieve in a short amount of time.It’s an incredible piece of work and I think it’s really interesting that it was created because you had been doing the supper club. So this work grew out of this transformational, beneficial experience for you.What I really love is this life/work synthesis. It’s not this idea that you have to run away from work and relax, it’s more that the two can synergise each other. I was reminded that one of our clients that we have now had come to a few of the dinners. So instead of having to go out and network at shit events I get to go and have good food with good people who then become clients.That’s amazing. I wanted to ask you a couple questions about how you feel about architecture in London and the future. This is kind of a general question, but what would you like to see more of?Awesome stuff.Great public spaces that are careful and thoughtful and generous and and buildings that are celebratory and beautiful and contribution to the landscape.Everything seems to be a little bit like a landscape of people on their phones: internalising, and giving nothing back. That’s what our architecture is like a little bit, this sort of landscape of internality but there’s nothing contributing to the stitch and fabric of the street.I’d love the planners to call upon every building to try a little bit harder; to give something back, which is not just — as so often — a tack-on structure. It’s just an absolute tragedy. So I think we need to change the way buildings are allowed to get built. It’s a restrictive system that allows shit to get built. So it’s a weird irony, where the cool stuff doesn’t get built because it’s not mediocre enough. We need a much more daring, design-led review.Would you say the restrictions placed on new builds are some of the biggest challenges that architects face?Yes, I would say that. I would say the administrative expense of putting up a building — rather than the purely constructional one — is repressive. The health and safety stuff, the fees for all kinds of consultants to satisfy all kinds of things, none of it goes into the building because it goes into paperwork. And it’s sort of understandable, it’s fucking fantastic that people don’t die anymore in this country compared to other ones, but it’s a difficulty and a tragedy and maybe an inefficiency of some sort. Because a lot of the way this bureaucracy works is unbelievably undigital. It’s still paper-based and therefore duplicated in the same way that our health system is and therefore money taken away from the builder.So how do you innovate and how do you stay creative within that system?I think one thing that does happen is that people retreat to conventionalism and fear and the thing they know that works — and they don’t take risks, and that’s a tragedy. If you’re going to do something that’s got some strand of design or art to it, it’s going to take a risk. In the same way with food, innovation requires moving away from the safety net of what we already know. You have to leave your fucking house, to go and explore. So that client mindset is required. The designer mindset obviously, but the client one to match. And that is often not the case. And in this country, for everything that it has historically done and innovated, is essentially quite a conservative country. We currently have a conservative government, but even every time we don’t have a conservative government it remains very conservative.Our buildings are often references to antiquity, to medieval times. We’re not an urban culture in Britain, we’re rural. Even London is a conglomerate of rural-ness. Even the tall buildings, they love the alleys between them more than anything else, the stuff of the 18th century. So that’s an extra challenge. It’s also an opportunity, in a way, because that is to embrace the small-scale ergonomics which is the space we operate in.I love that Japanese word that I rediscovered yesterday, ‘kawaii’ — do you know it?No what’s that?Kawaii means cuteness, basically. Those ridiculous emojis, little cats, cartoons and stuff. It’s such an integral part of Japanese culture. And I think in a weird way the English have a bit of Kawaii in their penchant for the teeny and tiny, the cute and the quaint, the fantasy of a pre-industrial arcadian wonderland. And it’s slightly anti-architectural, because they don’t really want the building to exist, they want to be subsumed by weeds in the garden, taken back to a simpler pagan time when buildings didn’t exist and all they had was the garden of life. And of course this romanticism has a big crossover with our worthy current ecological concerns.If you could name one thing, what do you think would make London architecture really great in the future?I think it’s politics rather than simply technology; both individual and collective will; visionary, dogmatic, centralised propositions for change. We need a driving force, it’s the politics that are the problem, really. With technology, there’s lots of ways of doing things, for instance, cheaply — but we don’t just need cheaper or quicker or more convenient; we need humanism; an attitude of creating extraordinary public realms and demanding amazing buildings, and preventing petty, mediocrity-carving politics from getting in the way of it.I think we need visionary-ness — not necessarily just from the architects — but from the very center of politics.
