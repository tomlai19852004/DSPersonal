Reason #4: Teacher Autonomy Over Best PracticesThis is the fourth post in a series entitled Why I Quit Teaching in Private Schools.One of the reasons teaching in private schools can be so enjoyable and rewarding for a teacher is that we are usually granted free reign to teach exactly what we want using methods we think work. When I was teaching, I loved this freedom! It allowed me to teach some of my favorite books and controversial topics in ways interesting and fun to me and my students (I think they liked it.) What’s not to love about that?Let’s think about that.I still remember my first year as a sixth grade history teacher. My department chair handed me a textbook and said, “Just cover age of exploration through colonial America and the American Revolution. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to find me or anyone else in the department.” While there were a number of folders full of handouts and the like left behind by the previous teacher, there weren’t any curriculum maps, skills charts, or even a departmental mission statement in existence to help me formulate my plan. I was in the deep end with no floaties.I learned an incredible amount that year, mostly things about myself and what it takes to be a good teacher; I had to learn to manage high levels of stress; I had to surrender to the fact that I could not know it all; I had to figure out how to burn the midnight oil every night trying to invent interesting ways to teach topics like bibliographies while still being “present.”Most challenging, I had to learn to kick like mad under the surface of those icy waters of doubt while trying to remain somewhat relaxed and calm for my students and parents.I survived, but I always wonder about those students. Did they get what they deserved that year? Did I really help them develop the skills they desperately needed to be successful in subsequent years? I shudder to really think about it.That is the dark side of autonomy.Fast-forward six years. After completing my master’s work in a program that really focused on child-centered theories and teaching methods, I found myself at the helm of an exciting divisional initiative, the most cherished position I have ever held at a private school: Best Practices Coordinator. A handful of middle school colleagues and I were lucky enough to work for a division director who supported this grass roots, teacher-lead improvement program. The result was a short but intensive division-wide effort to improve teaching and learning in the classroom via researched practices. In other words, I was given the gift of time (no coaching that year), a smidge of money, and a number of resources to help our division significantly improve how it educated young people.I still remember the wintery PD day when one of the more seasoned teachers in the middle school pulled me aside after a best practices sharing session: “Thank you. This is the most we have ever talked about getting better at teaching.”Sad to say, this type of comprehensive and targeted endeavor is a rare occurrence in private education, one I have yet to see or hear about elsewhere in its scope. One would think that private educators would never stop striving to be the best, most educated, and “current” practitioners of their craft. I mean, they are teaching in well-funded schools that attract the best and brightest, right?Tragically, when I left the school, the BP initiative slowly disappeared. Though over the years I have, time and time again, pushed leadership to replicate such programs in order to optimize student learning, reach all students, and ensure that we were meeting the needs of all of our idiosyncratic learners across divisions (thus living up to our mission), the response has always been roughly the same: we trust our teachers to teach the way they know best, and it has been working for this institution for a long time.Dark Secret: Teachers at independent schools are given a great deal of autonomy. Though this allows teachers to teach to their passions and remain creative, it can mean that teachers only teach what they want and how they want to, resulting in lopsided student skills acquisition and less-than optimal learning experiences for everyone (ex: though they both teach 7th grade humanities, Mr. B focuses mostly on research papers, multiple choice tests, and China, but Mrs. H loves South America and prefers art-based projects and personal narratives.)Please do not misunderstand me. Autonomy should be granted to teachers as much as possible, but not to the point where students miss key skills development or are forced to endure one teaching method instead of a variety of methods that are intentionally employed so to better reach more students more often?Imagine if this was to occur in other professions like medicine: “All that new research on non-invasive chemo protocols seems unclear to me, so I am going to stick with the double mastectomy like I have for years.”Even though brain research and medical scanning technology have exploded our understanding of how we learn, many of our finest school still allow teachers to do what they do without any institution-wide PD or assessable support. Sure, schools grant PD monies to teams or individuals who are working on a specific goal, but rarely will you see a school-wide, multi-divisional, structured commitment to the ever-evolving craft of teaching. The assumption remains that we private schoolers know what we are doing, so there is no real need for assistance (see Reason #1 in previous post.)Why would a school choose not to remain on the cutting edge of teaching and learning? How can schools exist without having best practices programs at the center of PD life?The answer here is a simple one: we don’t have to. Some schools do it anyway, but most do not. There isn’t a state governing body that looks over the shoulders of administrators and teachers in private ed to make sure they are doing what they should be doing, like in the public sector. State and regional associations grant accreditation, but those organizations rarely, if ever, mandate anything, except in extreme cases. In truth, those organizations, like ISACS in the Midwest, make broad recommendations only every seven years following a site visit by a team of teachers and administrators from other independent schools.My suggestion: Part of the accreditation process should mandate the creation of a school-wide (all divisions) internal Best Practices program, one that must meet weekly without fail, is tied to yearly teacher goals, is both evaluative and supportive, and which targets the use of research-based instructional strategies and planning methods. No need to pay expensive PD gurus tens of thousands of dollars. School leaders need only make space for teachers to experiment with research-proven approaches and give them the time to share what they learn with each other.It isn’t brain science…or, I guess is it.
