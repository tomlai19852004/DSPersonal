Maison Folie — NOX ArchitectureIf you’re an architectural student or enthusiast of design, I would like for you to purchase “Machining Architecture” by Lars Spuybroek (http://amzn.to/1JgjVCN.) I came across this little gem at Barnes &amp; Nobles during my university years. This book is fascinating and I continue to reference it after all these years. In a sentence, NOX is a design office mixed with science fiction. Plain and simple!Here’s why you need to get this book — diagrams, diagrams, and more diagrams! There’s wonderful construction of complex facades and floor plans too! The softcover book is full of curved exteriors, beams, and stresses the power of computer aided design. After seeing this book, you’ll agree with me when I say that NOX should be included amongst the architectural giants in regards to constructing creative and difficult forms.A word of caution — Don’t spend too much time exploring wicked forms! It’s a seductive exercise which can drain valuable time from other important architectural/design tasks! During my time at The School of Architecture at Florida International University (2006–2009), I spent way too much time exploring forms and spaces and blah blah blah. A lot of students did too considering we were learning surface heavy programs like Rhinoceros and Maya. No harm, no foul, I suppose. All I’m saying is if you go the route of organic/non-linear architecture, be sure to make appropriate deadlines for yourself. It’s very easy to get caught up with forms. Instead, find a good place with your formation and spend time making construction drawings or adding material. Think: How the heck are you going to put this together? Don’t just send it to the 3D printer without attempting the structural underbelly!Let me be clear: when I was in school, I was in love with exotic and non-linear surfaces. Nowadays I prefer Carlo Scarpa and Steven Holl. (Of course Rem Koolhaas has a special place in my heart!) Spend equal time on making shop drawings is where I’m getting at!
