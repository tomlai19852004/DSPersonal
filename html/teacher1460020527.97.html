Now, I take for granted the fact that I am intrinsically motivated to learn. I am currently a sophomore in the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern, where I’m studying Social Policy and English with the goal of becoming a high school English teacher after graduation.Hopefully, I’ll be able to impact students’ lives in the same way my own teachers impacted mine and to help make school a place where intellectual curiosity is the rule, not the exception.
