Can We Stop Wasting Architecture?What do we do with the rest of the Iceberg? According to the Guggenheim Foundation, 1,715 design entries were submitted for the Guggenheim Helsinki Museum Competition. Along with the winning entries that received their fair share of press, the foundation launched a website to highlight the sheer volume of various ideas that battled for the throne.But what happens with the other 1714 projects that didn’t get picked? Many of the competition entities withhold the rights to the ideas, yet it is unclear whether these ideas are utilized beyond their initial submissions.There is a widespread problem in the architecture discipline. Ideas are iterated in the form of drawings, models, digital models only to be tested against each other. The ones that fail in the survival of the fittest are discarded. Some lucky ones manage to survive to the final pin-ups as ‘process,’ often enraging the presenter when jury seem to favor the haphazardly taped chipboard model over the meticulously resolved 3D print.
