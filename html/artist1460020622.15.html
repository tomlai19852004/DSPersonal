UD: What are the reoccurring questions you pose through your work?CK: Structures have always fascinated me: How much can a structure be pushed or moved? What are the consequences? Would the entire thing fall to pieces if challenged? Would it adapt another equally functioning shape and form? Would the meaning change? Would its own rules, morals and norms change?I grew up surrounded by fields and forest in Germany. I remember building my own “houses” with tree branches and stones. I would outline rooms, make furniture of branches and tree trunks. I spent hours lost in my own imagination in those forests. In essence, as I discovered over time, I attempt to understand the idea, or consequences, for that matter, of pushing boundaries that are set — hence, changing the structure. That process is what interests me, and the answers to how a particular state of being would then manifest itself in a physical object.View from her studio with various test piecesTo view more images and read the full interview visit UpstateDiary.com
