Here’s the true problem, no matter what you want to argue about equivalence, the teacher’s feedback is absolutely useless. All the student got in order to explain this concept was “-1" and “3+3+3+3+3". What did you do to figure out why this was marked wrong? You Googled it. The same thing that this student could do if they ever ran into a use case where this was important. I suspect that the teacher probably wouldn’t have been able explain why this was wrong beyond pointing to an answer key and saying, “That’s the way the text says to do it.” The fact of the matter is until teachers grasp how to move beyond horrible, unhelpful, feedback their teaching will be ineffective whether they use the common core or not.
