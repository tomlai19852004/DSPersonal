On the future of architecture in the next 5–10 yearsPhillip: Hopefully we’re going to see more integration of some of the technologies that we’re working with in school and the office, out in the field. An area of research of mine is the area of construction and job sites- how we’re seeing anything from automation and computation. Can it become more ubiquitous and less about the machine? I’ve done some work with construction companies on this kind of thing. Seeing some of the technology become a bit more normal instead of something special. There are also interesting new technologies out there right now like VR or augmented reality which is making a come back- the goggles aren’t quite as big with the backpack GPS.Stephanie: Technology on site is going to evolve. It’s not so much the design part it’s more of the network and working with non-linear geometry. There’s a need for the construction field to look into other type of technologies.Phillip: Means of digital production are one area that everyone is getting into. Obama talks about 3D printing; everybody’s talking about it. How that changes the site as well.On advice they would give their younger selvesPhillip: One thing I always tell my students is to be patient because it took us a long time of slowly building up projects. We have a website and we do a little bit but we don’t really mark it. There’s no real way to go out and get clients as an architect- they just come. But at the beginning they didn’t come as fast. If people start their own firm it’s important that there’s an understanding. Even if you get one great project right out of school, it doesn’t mean that the next one will be. Think about the fact that we’re doing projects right now and thinking about the next one already. If you’re going to start a business you have to have another one coming and you have to be patient because it’s not easy. Also, go with your feelings. I sometimes question myself and get side-tracked on projects because maybe it wasn’t the design we wanted. We should’ve been persistent about that.Stephanie: When I went to school in France, I had the most boring architecture historian. The class was on Monday at 9am. Everybody was either sleeping or not there. I wish I was more concentrated on this- he was boring- but had an incredible knowledge. I did travel a lot and worked in different places, but I was always going back to New York; I wish sometimes that I had traveled more to other parts of Europe when I was a student. I would also say: don’t work for free.This post was previously published on blog.modelo.io on 1/27/16.
