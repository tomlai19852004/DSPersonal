Artists: Protect Your ContentIMAGE CREDIT: Creative Commons — Flickr user lensesdrillingPhysical artwork is hard to steal — assuming you’re not a character on White Collar or any of the dozens of TV shows and movies glamorizing the lives of art thieves. Online, it’s a different story. The topic of how to protect your intellectual property online comes up with every client I work with. It’s a hot-button issue and artists from every creative discipline are understandably very concerned with protecting their livelihood.Below are a few tips to help you protect your content online. However, you must know that a determined individual can pretty much steal anything they want.Take basic precautions on your website. Don’t want people pinning your content to Pinterest? There’s a piece of code for that. There are other browser features you can disable, like the ability to drag an image to your desktop, or right-click to save… but there are pitfalls and trade-offs. Talk to your web host or website template service to find out what basic precautions you can take to prevent the most common methods people steal images. If you don’t mind the cost, the most complete image protection out there is from ArtistScope.Don’t post your whole portfolio on Facebook. Social media should always be driving traffic back to your website, so consider using social media to post “teaser” images from your portfolio, and include a link to see the full gallery on your website. This will limit the number of images out there on Facebook, Instagram, etc. where you have less control over viewer’s ability to steal images. You might also consider using graphics, text overlays, or “watermarking” to make the image less useful to someone wanting to use it in another context. When posting to social media, avoid uploading full-res, print-ready files (I usually suggest 800–1000px on the long side, 72ppi, sRGB instead).Check for theft. Unlike a physical painting, theft of digital artwork isn’t as noticeable. If you don’t periodically check for theft, you may not ever know that it happened at all. Google’s Image Search tool is a great way to check for content theft. Once found, attempt to contact the website owner first with a “cease and desist” statement (contact your lawyer for the best tactics). If they’re non-responsive, follow up with a similar letter to the website’s host, who may be quicker to resolve the issue. Find out website owner information with WHOis.Protect your work before posting it online. In order for your “cease and desist” letters from #3 above to work effectively, you need to be following copyright law to protect your work in the first place. I am not a lawyer, but there are some good ones out there that specialize in protecting artists’ rights. A good lawyer can help advise you on the best copyright statements for your website and social sites. Best to have your ducks in a row before you need to defend your rights.I hope you found these tips helpful, and that you’ll get in touch with your web developer/host and your lawyer to find out more about how to protect your content online.
