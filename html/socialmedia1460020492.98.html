Lately I’ve been unable to shake the feeling that all the content in social networks, regardless of where it comes from, are ads. As much as companies have become creepy simulacrums of people, it seems people are also becoming more and more like ads. Facebook shows me things other people — friends! — have liked, and in that utterly bizarre dystopian future sort of way, I have to reconcile that despite having not spoken to a person since high school, I know that they “like” Buzzfeed and have helped feed the algorithm that Facebook uses to advertise at me. And I kind of hate them a little for it, which is itself darkly absurd.I remember there was a time when I enjoyed talking with people on Twitter or sharing something on Facebook. It seemed like a novel new way of interacting with people. But in the last few years it’s felt less and less like a conversation space and more and more like an unwanted extension of the self, constantly surveilled, and always needing to be a version of you that you’d feel comfortable with having out there, forever. I’ve mostly stopped talking and half-heartedly share a corgi photo now and again, so the algorithm knows I haven’t gone off and died.Long story short, I feel you.
