The Sound of Architecture — Part 1Music and architecture are a strange mix. One appeals to the ear, the other to the eye but seldom do we consider a much deeper embedded connection between the two.It’s difficult to sit here and deny that connection. Just a matter of days after listening to Daft Punk’s ‘Tron Legacy’ and ‘Homework’ at 3am on repeat, for a week straight. Whilst trying to muster some sort of thought process outside of the normal, in conjunction with coffee. Consumed like it’s going out of fashion.All in an attempt to develop a piece of architecture based on the notion of ‘mechanism’ for my final university masters design folio.Why would I seek such inspiration? What could the robots do for me at that point in time I could not do for myself?Bare with me as I attempt to explain a deep connection between music and architecture that most people don’t consider. Because when you look deeper at the facts it’s hard to deny.The simplest way to consider it is the link the two share based on face value. For as long as the two forms of creativity have existed, they have undoubtedly influenced each other. Music has defined how we design certain spaces. Spaces that need to ensure sound resonates in such a way that its pleasing to the ear. And in return architecture has redefined how music is made and then delivered to its audience. For example forms of electronic music and stadium rock are based solely on the experience you gain in conjunction with the architecture that facilitates it.NEW MUSIC CENTER FOR TORONTO’S WATERFRONTThen you begin to dig a little deeper below the surface, into history and recognize there was a slightly more abstract link.What would you think if I told you music was once a form of mathematics used for determining building proportions?You’d probably think the robots had gotten me and I was living on another planet. But then you’d have to say the same about Leon Battista Alberti, an Italian architect, who in the 1400’s devised a way of using musical composition to measure area and determine ‘harmony and proportions’.“We shall therefore borrow all our Rules for the Finishing our Proportions, from the Musicians, who are the greatest Masters of this Sort of Numbers, and from those Things wherein Nature shows herself most excellent and compleat.” Leon Battista AlbertiSo if music equals maths, and maths equals structure, and structure equals architecture; then surely architecture must equal structure, which must equate to musical composition and then in turn Daft Punk, which equals music. A sentiment that either makes a whole lot of sense or none at all. A sentiment I came up with at 3am in a completely sleep deprived state when I probably should have been focusing on my project.But what if there were a much more abstract connection that made you really wonder if indeed there is this deep embedded connection between architecture and music?I’m talking 1950’s architectural theory and 1990's gangster rap. Is there a chance there is indeed a correlation between the two?It would be difficult to imagine a circumstance where the parallels between an Italian architectural theorist and an American gangster rapper could be so similar, yet what seems initially to be a strange comparison isn’t so the more you study and compare their individual contexts.Manfredo Tafuri and Tupac Shakur; one was an Italian architectural theorist, the other an American rapper and social activist.MANFREDO TAFURITUPAC SHAKURNeither to my knowledge ever had anything to do with each other yet both defined legacies which have many bold and striking similarities.Further proving that my need for musical inspiration at 3am stems from a much greater relationship forged over history; as opposed to a coincidence or remedy for boredom.To be continued…
