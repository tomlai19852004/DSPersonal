You can’t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards.So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path and that will make all the difference. — Steve JobsThis was the singular idea that got me started on my journey.I started believing in it before the dropout, I believed it through out this year in solitude and I will always believe it.Not worrying about what’s in store for the future lets you give your best shot at the present. And if you learn to always give your best shot at the present, I would like to believe you are half way there.
