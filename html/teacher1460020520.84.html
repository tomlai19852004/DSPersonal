How design teachers approach design in the classroomWritten by Nadav Reis, InVision’s Campus Initiative Coordinator, and originally published on InVision’s blog.We’re so proud to say that design schools around the world use InVision in their classrooms to teach students not only how to design, but how to communicate and work with a team.Since the fall semester just came to a close, we caught up with some of our favorite professors and lecturers and asked them to share their thoughts on how they approach design in the classroom. And above each quote, you’ll find an image of one of their favorite student projects from the semester.“Good design creatively solves a problem that exists for a user. Great design solves a problem that a user didn’t even know existed.”— Allen Atha, ProfessorArt Institute of CaliforniaStudent project by Ashton Hayes
