Why not have a transparent section at the top(which will scroll upwards anyway), of equal size and the same position as the image? When the user scrolls upwards, the next section(that contains the actual tableView content) eclipses the UIImageView, and we can keep the regular zooming mechanics. Now, down to code!First, lets initialize the image view and the table viewIt’s mostly boilerplate code, just be careful to remember the height of the image and the y-coordinate of the tableView. We’ll need it later.Now, for the table view delegate code.The code is pretty much default table view code, except I’ve added a case for the first section(indexPath.section==0). This is specifically for the transparent section that will scroll over. It’ll have one row(for simplicity), a height of 330–80=250(height of the image- offset). It’ll also have no text and a clear background colour.Finally the zoom-on-overscroll code:So, a 100 lines of code total and our UI is a lot better. Here’s the final project in case somebody wants a look.PS: I’m open to exploring and reverse engineering more User Interface controls. Put up a note/comment here and I’ll do my best.PPS: I’m looking for internships/jobs as an iOS developer in the near future. In case you’re interested, here (it’s a mailto: link)
