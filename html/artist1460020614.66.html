Every Artist should take this into consideration, Art is priceless and the artist doing those should have all the right to get paid for creativityÂ .When a Artist draws, they always give there best to create the best. So as per that they should be paid for there efforts.No company have the right or should never pay less then the Artist ability, and the Artist on the other hand should never compromise with there creative skills too.
