An Artist’s FrustrationI’m not sure if it’s the fact that I’m turning 30 in a few weeks or the sort of crossroads in my life and career I find myself at right now, but I have been super introspective lately. It’s the kind of introspection that started as a pro/con list for a potential opportunity, but swiftly delved into “What is the point of any of this?” territory. It got real.In my formative years — high school, now over ten years behind me — I was so certain of my path. I had an unusual grasp of myself for my age, which I blame on reading way too much Ayn Rand. My aptitude in fine art had been a big part of my identity my entire life, and in high school I honed my skills and felt more certain than most 18-year-olds of my purpose in life. I believed then, and still believe now, that at our core each of us has a very human instinct to leave behind a legacy. To make it matter that we lived. For most folks I think that having children fulfills that need. While that’s valuable and admirable, I never thought it could be that for me. My work as an artist had to be my legacy.My high school years were some of the most productive years of my artistic life. I maniacally pushed myself further and further, knowing that the next step had to be getting into (and affording!) art school. I reached that goal and everything seemed on track until a tv show called “The West Wing.”One of the biggest differences between myself and most of the art students I was now studying alongside was that music never spoke to me the way it did to them. The cliche of the art student hipster name dropping obscure indie artists is a cliche for a reason. But what music was for them, television was for me. I even bought a portable DVD player so I could paint listening to the dialog of my favorite shows during classes. But the West Wing soon became more than that for me.A high achiever from humble beginnings sort of scratches the surface, but that first binge-watch of the West Wing soon had this Ayn Rand devotee reconsidering everything.Take a 22 year old Libertarian who thought they had everything figured out, a new West Wing obsession that was undermining some of my most basic tenants about the world, and add a class assignment to illustrate the unlikely rise of Senator Barack Obama and you get this: At midnight on January 6th, 2008 moments after watching the famous 2004 speech that Senator Obama gave at the Democratic Convention I bought a bus ticket to New Hampshire.I had no idea what I was doing, but I figured it out, got hired a few states later in the primaries, and didn’t really leave the campaign trail again until 2014. The line that did me in, and still gets me even today, was “…for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her who have the grades, have the drive, have the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college.” That was me, and while yes, I did work hard and get there I still recognized that any of the factors outside of my control could have made that hard work irrelevant.So I spent six years on a completely different path, usually so busy that I never evaluated what this meant for my life plan.Coming out of all of this in late 2014, I finally started to deal with it. Those six years had been fruitful and I had accomplished great things, but in my heart I always knew I wanted to return to my original path. That I should return to that path. I has hired as a graphic designer at a statewide association and began to put those original dreams back together. What I was unprepared for was the sheer volume and intensity of frustration I had lurking beneath the surface.I feel like that impromptu bus trip prompted a schism within me that I’ve been ignoring for years. Art had remained my primary identity in that time, but I spent six years building a life and career and skill set for another passion. I never considered that. I applied the same work ethic I had always had for art to this new field and achieved perhaps an apex of success. At the end I considered my move back to be just righting the timeline. But I was inexplicably unhappy.It was months of reflection and searching before I could realize that this frustration I am feeling was a result of never had re-evaluated those original expectations I set forth for my life so long ago. In fact, I was furious at myself for not being at the same level in my art career as I was in my political one. Because wasn’t that always supposed to be just a detour in regards to my actual purpose as a human being?More than just a crossroads of potential interests or career choices, I started to question even my most basic assumptions. My identity as an artist and my plan to make my mark as an artist — did that just stem from a talent in the field and an early judgement that it was most likely course to leave a mark with? If so, doesn’t my success in field politics, where I have changed the courses of elections and thus lives kind of invalidate that thinking?When you bring up ‘purpose of life’ type ponderings at a bar with friends, you get a lot of, “making the most of the time we have,” and “doing what makes you happy.” But I always felt that there was an argument for responsibility. If you are lucky enough and work hard enough to potentially be of value in a field, do you then have some responsibility to not let that value go to waste? I began to be frank with myself. What if I am actually just more talented in this other career? How could it then make sense to go about my life now as perhaps always a middling graphic artist, or should I return to a field where I am already meeting my self-expectations?My heart tells me that I am being unreasonable in my self-frustration. That I can’t make a judgement on my work and compare it to the successes I have attained in a field that I just spent six years working in. That even if my original art identity was premature or not wholly formed, I owe it to myself to give it a real chance and find out. And not throw my hands up six months in and say “Well, I’m not where I wanted to be yet, so screw it.”There’s a great quote from Ira Glass, illustrated by Zen Pencils here, that reasons that the gap for creative artists between the work they create and the quality they aspire to, and the disappointment that gap causes in yourself, is the indication that you have the taste, judgement, ambition, and capacity to get there (with a lot of hard work).So maybe it’s a good thing that I can be dissatisfied with where I am after just six months. Admittedly, it’s hard to force myself to relent that time and space at almost 30. So many ‘what ifs’ flood my mind every day. Where would I be in this chosen field if I hadn’t ever taken a detour? And some of this is completely self-indulgent. It felt good to be at the top of a field. It feels good to get job offers from all over the country because I can do something valuable and it’s recognized. But I think I understand now that even if I were to oblige this knee-jerk reaction to go back, the question of my ultimate identity and path won’t go away until I let myself explore it.I’m going to give myself that time. I’m going to let myself be less than amazing at something until I know that even if this path won’t be my definitive legacy, then at least I will have been fair in deciding it wasn’t.
