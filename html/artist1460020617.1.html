Artists“They’re delusional. Keep your day jobs!”In my opinion, artists are so important because we need other people to express how we feel, because we’re not able to. We either don’t know how or cannot. Along the same vein, entertainers are popular because they distract us so we don’t have to deal with our own emotions. Artists visualize emotion.Some art is not great. I believe that art that hasn’t connected to who we really are is because the artist has not connected to why she/he is creating this art. So they should keep their day jobs.Struggling artists therefore struggle with the purpose of their art or are misinterpreting it. They need to see the why of their art for it to be truly valuable.Fine. No more judging. Struggling artists are real and they provide the bottom seed that inspires bigger movements. They’re just artists who are struggling with their art. They can’t come up something that beautiful (yet) but we need them in this ecosystem of humanity. Besides, I’m not in competition with them so I might as well just cheer them on their struggle.Just know that you’re not a rapper. You’re an artist.You’re not a swimmer. You’re an artist.You’re not a florist. You’re an artist.You’re entertainment. You’re inspiration. You COULD be valuable, but you gotta know why.Anyways, this reminds me that we need more day jobs. We gotta clean this mess up. Some artists are fucking up so bad and need to clean up their mess. For each unfulfilled career, there’s a broken dream. For each meaningless job, there’s a life unfulfilled. Let’s make great jobs and fulfilling careers
