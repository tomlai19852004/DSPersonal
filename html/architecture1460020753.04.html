On the challenges facing small firm architectsThere are two things we’ve learned through EntreArchitect as far as the challenges facing small firm architects. Number one, they’re overwhelmed with the number of things they’re doing. The number of roles they’re responsible for is overwhelming. So they’re looking for ways to be more productive in the ways they’re living their lives. So that is one area we focus on a lot: how to live a more productive, more effective, happier life as a small firm architect. One of our goals is just to help architects be happier and help them reach the dreams they wanted when they first started. Many architects start out wanting to change the world as artists but quickly find out they need to become business people first. None of us know how to do that. So EntreArchitect really allows us to educate and connect with these firms and help them become more successful.The other thing many firms struggle with is the fact that they don’t know how to run a business. They don’t know how to be profitable. So giving them the tools and education and know-how to build systems is really the key to being a more productive and profitable architecture firm. This is what allows them to be the artists they want to be.On changes for small firms in the next 5–10 yearsI think virtual firms are going to be the new norm for startups. It’s very easy to get a decent computer and some software and set up a website and get yourself licensed and open up your firm. So you can essentially open up a firm for a few thousand dollars, where before you’d have to rent space and hire a staff and pay utilities and all of that. It was a big investment and a big risk to start your own firm. Today with a virtual firm the risk is significantly less so if it didn’t work, you didn’t spend a whole lot of money on it. And what you invested in could certainly be used if you go and work for someone else. So I think many startups and small firms are going to shift to this new model working as a virtual firm. As technology gets better and new tools become available, it’s only going to get easier and less expensive to do that.On advice he would give his younger selfThat’s an easy one. Learn how to run a business. I speak at schools occasionally to students and the thing I always like to leave them with is definitely learn the fundamentals of business. I have a presentation I give called Profit, Then Art and it’s the 12 fundamentals to a successful business in architecture. There are basically 12 things you need to know and understand how they work and apply them to your business then you will be successful. You’ll have the profit in order to run a successful firm and this will allow you to be a better architect. I think so many architects feel like being profitable is this bad thing because it takes away from their art. My argument is if you can focus first on building a strong business and putting in place the systems you need to be a strong, healthy, profitable business then you’ll have more time and freedom to be the artist you want to be. So that is definitely my number one recommendation.This post was previously published on blog.modelo.io on 11/18/15.
