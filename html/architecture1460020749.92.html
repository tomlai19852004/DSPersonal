On his processI don’t like talking about process usually, especially about how things are made. Too much talking about process can drive the conversation towards things like the fidelity to technique or virtuosity of technology and I like talking about content more. But generally speaking, digital modelling is a large part for me. Generally we’re using Rhino 3D modelling software and a handful of other plugins for that. In terms of fabrication software though, it always varies. As far as representation, I’m interested in large scale models — the Belvedere model is about eight feet tall and the domes are around five and half feet. So that requires a different sensibility of how you go about making something. It can’t hinge as much on abstraction, or at least not quite as easily. So that introduces other problems with the actual making of the thing. Procedurally for me the work always begins with digital modelling. If there is hand sketching involved it’s usually pretty quick and gestural. Most of the work happens through the computer. It’s also true that most of the people that I work with are often dispersed in different cities. So the digital environment for me becomes a way to trade models and information more easily.On the future of architecture in the next 5–10 yearsI think there are a couple of places change could come to. What’s troubling on the one hand but also necessary is the movement or drive towards sustainability as a kind of commodity — and one that has become a global narrative of the profession is becoming seen. Its not that its not important, but that as a conversation or point of emphasis it’s problematic in that it drives attention away from other modes of sustainability that we could be talking about such as cultural or disciplinary sustainability in the field. I’m not sure that that is a huge disruption but I also think that its symptomatic of the tendency to subdivide and carve out a niche, and that the further we drive issues into sub-categories within the field, the less of conversation we can collectively have.But of course there will also always be changes in technology that shift conversations — hopefully towards architectural problems and applications — as well as seminal projects that spur new modes of attention and debate. But overall, it seems likely that the field will continue to subdivide into different expertise groups and that shared interests usually common to the field will dissipate into other fields — architecture could possibly have less and less to do with buildings, built environments, or disciplinary research.
