5 Education Apps Teachers Can Be Thankful For In 2015For teachers, Thanksgiving is often a chance to catch up on grading and enjoy a short break in the lead-up to the report cards, presentations, and final exams that take place just before winter break. There is no shortage of applications designed to help teachers, and here are 5 excellent websites teachers can be thankful for in 2015:Plickers (https://www.plickers.com/)Plickers is a free application that allows teachers to collect student responses and checks for understanding in real time. The best part about this application is that students don’t need to be in a 1:1 technology setting, or even have their own device: Plickers uses the teacher’s device, in combination with printed QR codes, to collect student responses.2. Formative (https://goformative.com/)Formative lets teachers create formative assessments (or convert existing paper assessments to a digital format) and assign them to students. Live results delivered to the teacher, provide a great opportunity to give timely, relevent feedback to students.3. Goalbook (https://www.goalbookapp.com)Goalbook provides teachers with tools that help differentiate learning for their students. Using strategies aligned with the Universal Design for Learning framework, Goalbook uses research-based best practices to help teachers plan and implement instruction that engages all students.4. Flocabulary (https://www.flocabulary.com/)Flocabulary has a huge collection of educational hip-hop songs and videos for students in all grades. This application is a highly engaging way to help students build vocabulary and increase achievement.5. Zaption (http://www.zaption.com/)Zaption is an innovative, easy-to-use tool that lets educators create engaging video lessons. By creating “learning tours”, teachers can use Zaption to make viewing videos an active, engaging experience for students. Teachers can also track student responses to gain helpful insight into how students are progressing through the lessons they create.Related: Not (just) Another User Name and Password! 4 Ways to Gauge the Effectiveness of Your School or District’s Latest Technology InitiativeOf course, there are many new, innovative solutions being introduced into classrooms, and this is just a snapshot.
