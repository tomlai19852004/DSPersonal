No. For what it’s worth I’m a former math teacher and I appreciate Brett’s effort to encourage trust in good teaching. But this is not good teaching and Brett is wrong to defend it. While, as the Wikipedia article points out, three groups of four is “often written as 3 x 4”, this is not equivalent to a definition of the meaning of “3 x 4”. Yes, “3 x 4" can mean three groups of four, but it can also mean four groups of three. In situations where the distinction is important, other means than syntax must be employed to indicate the difference. There simply is no standard, widely accepted interpretation of the syntax of multiplication. I suspect that a poll of mathematicians would reveal as much. For a teacher to declare that their interpretation is the standard, and then insist that students follow it is just bad teaching. Yes, syntax is important in programming and in matrix multiplication. No, insisting that students follow a made-up syntax for multiplication of whole numbers is not a good way to teach this.Being an effective math teacher is not easy. It requires trying to understand the ways that a student interprets a concept and then helping the student to expand their thinking to include other interpretations. This is not accomplished by enforcing non-existent rules of notation.
