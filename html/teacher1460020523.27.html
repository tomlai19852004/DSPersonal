We’ve learned so much about new teacher development from ACE that our whole approach to training new teachers has shifted as a result. Now, we focus our pre-service, summer training on a discrete set of core skills we’ve identified as most essential for new teachers when they first set foot in the classroom. Those foundational skills lay the groundwork for developing more complex skills throughout the first year. We’ve also transformed our training program to give new teachers more time for practicing skills, instead of just learning about them in the abstract, and we’ve defined a coaching model that gives teachers more hands-on guidance while they’re actually teaching. Together, thanks to the data we’re gathering from ACE and the changes we’ve made to our training as a result, we’re producing better new teachers than when we began.“My coach gives me strategies that I can apply the very next day. I initially had trouble grouping my students for classwork. My coach helped me cluster students so I could target key areas for improvement. On the next assessment, all of my students met or exceeded their goals.”-Kelsey Rieck, 2012 Chicago Teaching FellowThat’s just the beginning of our teacher development story, though. As we learned more about new teachers’ development arcs, we started to wonder what happens beyond the first year. How do we ensure that the teachers we train are not only strong practitioners when they earn their certification, but also that we’ve laid the groundwork for their continued growth? How do teachers really improve over time, and what does it take to move the needle on teacher performance at scale?Tell us what you think. We’ll share some of our latest thinking in our next post.
