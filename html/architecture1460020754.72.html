A framework for understanding and reinventing the architecture of culture.Disclaimer: I am not by any means, in my own views, a professional writer. I just tend to write down my thoughts in a personal journal form, edit them as best as I can, and I figure some of my entries are worth posting. I don’t consider myself an expert in the fields of my discussions but I believe my feelings are worth sharing.Society is not representative of what’s possible/what’s real. We do not know it all. We do not have it figured out and that is okay. We have not plateaued in our idea of the true architectural possibility of pure existence. We can never passively view the framework and surfaces of all that makes up the enterprise of experience and never dare to connect the dots of unspoken and well hidden phenomena to be an architect and pioneer of a completely new and rebuilt society based on that which serves the best parts of human possibility. On the whole, we are failing to acknowledge the intellectual dishonesty, fail to question the source of our current systemic World and the ideals that make up the machine churning out ideas; projecting the concept of that which you are given and that which is asked of us, and ultimately all that is available. An authoritarian model that produces unquestioning consumers. Aiming the spotlight and forcing your focus on frequencies and ideas that lock you into anti-exploration. I’ve spent the last few years ferociously delving into the root of the plans and the devices of the architects of our current culture and have come to find, Time and time again, that it is sinister and intentionally limiting. Every element of life hijacked. The truth behind the origin of humanity manipulated and suppressed. Our image of each other reduced to participation in separation mindset, competition, that your ascension requires another’s oppression, their can only be one winner, that there is so little to go around. Basic human inalienable rights blown off as utopia or too difficult to reattain. We are told we are too far gone. Sinister devices overdecorated in egoic and dishonest packaging; adorned in so much convolution that the pursuit to unfold it proves itself too exhausting to engage in, and should ben left to an unknown expert whom we automatically trust. A cultural machine framing your perception of what is important, masking the most destructive parasites to our evolution and personal freedom with mundanity, passivity and harmlessness. There is a war out to imprison the mind and force the adoption of the notion that you have ultimately decided on your own what your life will be, and the insight necessary to truly examine the subliminal conditioning that is ever present and all around us, and sadly within us is a domain under lock and key. Told that revolution is a worthless endeavor upon which a single individual cannot affect. Further, they exacerbate the negative space in our ego that would not dare recant on current conviction and doctrine, even dogma and half-truth.In the face of this I am also finding that at the root of honest human inner-examination, in a hallway of the human soul that can’t be accessed by culture, a labyrinth made of purity, we are faced with our boundless dynamic for the capacity to influence and infinite personal possibility now in conflict with what is really going on, and bursting at the seems of our consciousness is a tipping point and an access to our own light that can exterminate the darkness of the very lie that is our society and the culprits behind this masterful scheme which is cohesive and synchronized and systemic. It is not coincidental. It is not broken. I am alarmed and subsequently in aims to recapture my soul from propoganda and infected memes. This agenda can be faltered by the power of awareness. I am left with moral obligation to contribute to awareness and progress, but the mind has to be willing to swallow the reality of just how far it goes. It requires objectivity and fierce research. Lets do it together. Let’s reclaim our minds and move into, at least at first, a space of reinvention.-Shane Carrigan
