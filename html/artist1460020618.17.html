Maria Magenta —an artist who starts to win people’s hearts.“Art. Love. Happiness. Harmony. When you reflect on these words recently? Our life is so colorful and it’s a frightfully good thing when you can see how delightful it is. Maria Magenta is a painter who shows some colors of life on her canvases. All what she needs is a good company if it is a model who is sitting for her. All what she wants — to translate life into her oil colours. Translate it so bright and colorful.”Petr Lenyaev
