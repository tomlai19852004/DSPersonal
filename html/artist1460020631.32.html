Let’s get artists paid: Moving forward at Ghostly, Drip to KickstarterI’m very proud for Drip to be Kickstarter’s first acquisition. It was always our dream that the concept would be embraced by a larger, like-minded community. My long friendship with the founders — Yancey, Perry, and Charles — gives me great confidence in the future of Drip.For those just joining us now, Drip is a platform that pioneered a new kind of direct subscription for musicians and indie labels. It was inspired by the fans and the artists we work with at my company, Ghostly International. Subscriptions bring the fans closer to the art they love and create a reliable support system for the artists.Music and art has always been an important way for me to connect with people. I became excited in the idea of direct subscription in 2006 and registered my first “drip” domain name the same year, knowing one day we would get to put it to use.We all want to belong. We created Drip to help people find and foster those connections and tried not to be distracted by prevailing narratives that claimed financial support in art and music was waning. With the advent of Kickstarter and ideas like Drip, we can now begin to focus on all of the exciting ways artists can connect to their people.In many ways the Drip team acted as catalysts for the creative community we engaged, convincing artists and small businesses that they had value beyond the things they made. We believe people want to support artists for who they are and a chance to see what they may do next.Building Drip has been a beautiful and humbling experience. In Berlin nightclubs, LA coffee shops and on Skype with artists, labels and managers, I was responsible for sharing my vision and answering the question, “What’s a ‘drip?’” Over time, the words changed, but the concept stayed the same: a culture flow of information and art. The job of explaining our mission — and indeed the mission itself — will be realized much more globally now.I’ve learned a lot from working with my co-founder Miguel Senquiz who will be joining the Kickstarter team. And I’m honored by the people who made up our team and who all bore the emotional risk of founders in the act of making something new.I’ve chosen to continue with my passions at the company I founded, Ghostly, which acts as a living laboratory of culture and continues to inspire me every day. I started drawing Ghostly’s logo in high school; discovered our first artist, Matthew Dear, in my first week of college; and this year we’re set to release records from five inspiring new artists alongside our favorites. As design lovers at The Ghostly Store, we’re working inside our happy place at the intersection of art, music and technology, collaborating with likeminded partners Warby Parker, Snarkitecture, and a few that I can’t say just yet.I’m grateful for the support of the Ghostly team in trusting us to take Drip all the way from conversations with our fans and whiteboard daydreaming to a new home. And I can’t wait for our next big idea.Art is the most important thing in expanding our hearts and minds. It’s more than worth the journey.
