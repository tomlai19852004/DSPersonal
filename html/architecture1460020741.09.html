In reality, adapting agile project management techniques in architecture may not be feasible, because of the rigid processes and regulations that are already in place within the building industry today.However, as the demand for affordable housing in urban regions increases, I believe that an agile approach to architecture could be the answer. A design framework that is not only sensitive to the usersâ€™ present needs but also takes into account the future changes, should be the norm in architecture and could be the solution that we need today.
