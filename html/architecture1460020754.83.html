Responsive Architecture in the HomeFurniture that Learns &amp; Teaches, Courtesy of Fast Co DesignHow will responsive architecture change the home?Two of the first questions that comes to mind are; in what ways will the home react to situations and the atmosphere and what do we want the home to be able to react to for a higher return on life?Possible scenarios I see arriving sooner than later;Crime &amp; Disaster — Smart planning, communication, &amp; defense in reaction to either neighborhood crime alert or approaching weather / environmental damage by communicating from one home to another within a neighborhood and then with data-relaying, from neighborhood to neighborhood to rescue and repair crews. Touched on that here.“As part of the Future Venice Project, Rachel Armstrong, one of the leading figures in the field of Architecture &amp; Synthetic Biology, has proposed that protocells could be used to grow an artificial limestone reef reinforcing the foundations of Venice. Protocells are chemical agents that behave in lifelike ways (such as growth and multiplication). They can therefore be manipulated to both form and sustain a material, in this case a reinforcing ‘biocrete’ for the foundations of Venice. This application of ‘living technology’ could see huge changes in our approach to architecture and sustainability in the coming years.” — Design Curial“But the real innovation is its mutability. “A good urban building can accommodate as many unforeseen events as possible,” architect Reinier de Graaf,” — Fast Co. Design2. Temperature and Weather — for cooling and heating in all atmospheres and climates depending on the amount of guests or residents within a home and what they feel like (possibly communicated through a wearable device or sensors)Buildings That Breathe | Doris Sung’s Living Architecture:3. Cleaning, Coming Home, Activities —Alongside from defense, security, and temperature, there’s clearly room for sensors to grow and digify the home in ways we haven’t thought of and that data will open our eyes to, which Reform does a great job of explaining here.Via Reform:Courtesy of the Reform PublicationI see management of responsive architecture evolving into control by resident users via smart phone and/or augmented reality glasses that may save preferences or preset customizations, “work mode”, “fitness mode”, “cleaning mode” [which could push furniture back to get into tight spaces and release robotic cleaners etc], “entertainment mode” and on from there.Any of the strenuous or menial tasks that are repeated often throughout the home will likely be automated and in many cases, utilize responsive architecture to increase efficiency and reach.On the other side of responsive architecture, we have the capability to now improve the home and its functionality and entertainment ability in new and unexplored ways that we will certainly pay close attention to.
