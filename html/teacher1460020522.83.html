Why teachers should strive to be like Mr. KeatingSo the other day, I was thinking about the movie Dead Poets Society, and thought how awesome it would be if I could incorporate one of my favorite movies into a blog post. So, here it is.For those who have not seen Dead Poets Society (in which case, I highly recommend you watch it), or if you have seen it and need a refresher, here is a brief synopsis and here is the movie trailer (don’t worry, no spoilers). I will try to keep my points short, and not give a lot away for those who have not seen the film.So, one of the major characters in this movie is Mr. Keating. Mr. Keating not only teaches his students English, but he teachers them so much more. On the first day of class, he has a student read a few lines from “The Virgins to make Much of Time” with the line “gather ye rosebuds while ye may”. Mr. Keating tells them about carpe diem, meaning seize the day, because no one lives forever. He encourages the boys to make their lives extraordinary. Although the boys think that the lesson is really weird, Mr. Keating is teaching them an something that is oh so important, especially to the boys going to an elite preparatory school and living to fulfill their parents wishes instead of their own.“Stars and Stripes Rosebud” by Audrey (CC BY)Mr. Keating doesn’t stop there. After having a student read the first paragraph of the introduction of their poetry textbook, he declares it to be excrement, and orders the boys to rip out the entire introduction. Although the boys are hesitant and first, they do as they are told. Mr. Keating doesn’t want the boys to be rating poetry as this introduction tells them to. He wants them to create their own thoughts on what they read. He wants the boys to decide how the poetry makes them feel, rather than focusing on rating it on this scale. He tells the boys “No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.”Mr. Keating stands on his desk, telling the boys, “I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we should constantly look at things in a different way.” He goes on to say, “Boys you must strive to find your own voice, because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all.” All of their other teachers emphasize that they need to learn the material, do their work, and go on to do, not what they want to do, but what their parents want them to do or what the administrators of the school want them to do. Now, this teacher is telling them to do what they want to do, because they have their own voice, their own thoughts, their own desires, and their own dreams. They are their own person, and they should find their own voice.Mr. Keating gives the boys the assignment of composing their own poem. One student is not able to compose his own poem. Mr. Keating knows that this boy does not think he has anything important inside of him that is worthwhile or important. So, he brings the student up to the front of the class, shows him a picture of Walt Whitman, covers his eyes, and asks him to describe what he sees. The boy ends up speaking a poem right then and there. His peers sit in shock. Mr. Keating goes up to him and tells him “Don’t you forget this.” Mr. Keating doesn’t just give up on the student, or tell him that he needs to bring a written poem tomorrow. He helps the student dig down deep, speak a poem on the spot, and shows him that he does have important thoughts and that what he thinks is important.Mr. Keating has 3 boys walk, and they all start off at their own stride, but then fall in step with each other. This is done to illustrate conformity, which is commonplace at Welton. He tells the boys that it is important to stick to their own beliefs, even in the presence of others, not matter how difficult it may be to do so. He encourages them to find their own stride.Mr. Keating receives backlash from the administration. They warn him not to teach these young, impressionable boys to be free thinkers. They say that the boys will never be happy if they have dreams that they then find are unattainable. Mr. Keating doesn’t change.So, why do I think teachers need to be more like Mr. Keating? What is the whole point of all of this? In today’s school system, students are stressed to the max. I went through not that long ago, and I see the stress of students in my field observations every week. There is a constant pressure for students to do well. Do well in your classes, do well on the standardized test, join extra curricular activities and do well in all of those, all of this is important for your future, if you fail at anything you will not get into a good college and go on to be successful. We are so focused on shoving information down students throats, that we forget to tell them that they are individuals. I want my future students to tell me what they think about things, and not just regurgitate what they read from the textbook. I want them to find their own voice and form their own views and opinions. I want my future students to only join activities they want to join, not the activities they fell they have to join. I want my future students to follow the path they want to follow, not the path their parents followed, or their sibling followed, or the path society wants them to follow.We need to teach our students to be free thinkers. Imagine how dull this world would be if we all thought the exact same. We cannot teach our students conformity, not if we want a world of unique thinkers with innovative ideas. I want to encourage my students to find their own voice, look at things in different perspectives, and not conform. I feel it is more important now than ever. In a world where popular ideas can be found at our fingertips, and standardized tests with definite answers are common, it is easier for students to conform. That is why we need to teach like Mr. Keating.
