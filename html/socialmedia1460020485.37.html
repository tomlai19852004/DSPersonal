Our tools matterBoth of the examples above illustrate how brittle our real time news and discovery systems are. Much has been written about how the business of gathering news has been upended — I don’t want to rehash those issues here, there isn’t room to do them justice. What is important to state is that while we are living through an era of reinvention of our news systems we have to ensure that what comes out the other end is better than what we had previously. A democratic society requires news and information systems for citizens to make informed choices. While the real time nature of information distribution is unlike anything we have previously had the discovery tools are still weak.Google search has become increasingly tuned to social data as the first example above illustrates. The recent deal between Twitter and Google suggests this tuning is only going to increase. On the Twitter side of the table, search hasn't evolved. Discovery is still rudimentary on site and third party tools are thin. Facebook same. Better discovery tools are needed — just as we saw with the rise of spam in email, these forms of propaganda, with fake or fabricated news, undermine trust in the platforms that carry them. If they don’t address this new platforms will emerge for discovery. The same for attribution. Some people believe that the social infrastructure of the Internet is basically complete — we don’t believe that is the case. Ever since the start of the Internet its social framework has been under construction and reconstruction. Twitter, Facebook and others need to evolve or die.Attention please, not just clicks:Tightly coupled with discovery are the tools for measurement — to an extent you build what you measure. Tony, CEO of Chartbeat, has written and spoken extensively about the attention web and why attention, time on page, time on site — real attention metrics are what matter. Last year I wrote a post here on medium about how attention and reading are evolving. We are living in an era of unprecedented transparency — and interestingly many of these hacks are happening in broad daylight. Unless we measure and value attention — time spent reading, listening, or viewing versus the raw click volume we aren’t going to build things that are actually of interest to humans. Take note of how bots are being used as part of these hacks. Just as Google made a concerted effort to track and expose viewability metrics in 2014 the social networks are going to have to think about how to expose attention metrics and help publishers understand outside of the torrent of shares what are people actually reading.Connections:To effectively hack media, you need to penetrate and then connect across dense people networks. This was a lesson of #deadhorse vs. ISIS/France and the Sony Hack. In the latter examples the hacks spread across dense networks. Max Fisher (the author of the Vox article) is connected into very different networks than Vox.com or Ezra Klien. This assisted in how it spread across the network and a reason why it influenced Google’s search algorithm. And we should also not view these hacking events as unidirectional. I suspect we will see examples of states and non-states hacking revenge media. The FBI started an investigation a few weeks back in December into whether corporations — banks and others — are already revenge hacking. This is going to get very complicated and hard to parse.Perspectives matter:My assumption has always been that increased transparency would result in a greater efficiency of information flow and that in turn, would naturally bend towards facts. Put another way, in an open society, with efficient information flow, fact and truth will win out. It’s impossible to measure this on the aggregate — and I believe that on the aggregate that is true — but its clear there are local cases where this simply isn’t the case. Russia is far more open a society than it was 30 years ago. Or turn to the Middle East and take a read of Gilad’s post about Israel, Gaza, War &amp; Data. Or dig into how fake sites made up news about a Texas town under quarantine for Ebola to harvest clicks, or how “real” news sites make up news. Or Craig Silverman’s piece on how a Priest died and met God in the “48 minutes” before he came back to life. In all these cases transparency isn’t succeeding at winnowing out bullshit. And mainstream media offer an implicit assist by assuming its role is to be the established view from nowhere.Media critics like Jay Rosen use the term, ‘view from nowhere’ to describe how some media strives to find a balance between objectivity and the reporting of facts, often erring on the side of reporting each side of an argument. They offer each perspective equal weighting, setting up the false impression that both perspectives are equally valid since they required equal coverage. As Rosen outlines (in a debate with himself) mainstream media are loath to say: ‘this is rubbish.’ They want to provide “perspective” — rather than take a position. And in today’s optimized world they want to generate SEO and social traffic from both sides of an argument.Match this phenomenon with the torrid pace of sharing before or without reading and you have a toxic mix that can be effectively gamed or hacked. In the post I wrote last summer I noted how a huge percent of articles shared are never actually read: “Chartbeat looked at user behavior across 2 billion visits across the web over the course of a month and found that … a stunning 55% spent fewer than 15 seconds actively on a page.” Transparency was meant to be the new objectivity. Yet if people aren’t reading before they share — if mainstream media is balancing every perspective, if headlines without branded context are now content — media can and will be hacked, and perspective will be narrowed rather than broadened.As Dmitry Tulchinskiy, bureau chief Rossiya Segodnya, said in August: “What is propaganda? Propaganda is the tendentious presentation of facts …It does not mean lying.” Tendentious — expressing or intending to promote a particular cause or point of view — with such a clear choice of words, I wish he had talked more about the methodology.This essay is from the betaworks 2015 book.
