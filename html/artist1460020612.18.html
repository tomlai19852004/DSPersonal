Peter’s robotic drawing installation in action:Recently I have​ started to offer this experience directly to clients in their own homes. I have​ ​a portable set up that can be installed within a family home and people can​ live with and interact with the robots for a duration of time. This becomes in​ a way a family portrait that documents the history of this time period through​ sound. When buyers purchase one of my drawings I hope it resonates with then in​ a way that they can continue to discover new moments within the compositions as​ they experience them over time.Isotope #10, 2015. Ink on Wood. 24" H x 18" W. $750. Available for purchase in the Bluebird Art app.You are not only an artist, but also a collector. When did you start buying original art?I started collecting original art while I was an undergraduate in the printmaking department at the University of Washington. The department was really active and some amazing artists came through the program. I was able to start trading and purchasing prints and drawings from friends. After I graduated from my MFA program (at San Francisco Art Institute) I worked for almost a decade at a commercial gallery in SF that dealt in prints, maps and paintings from the 15th — 20th Century. Through this connection I gained a wealth of knowledge about this type of work and started collecting pieces from that period myself. For a while I was really into antique maps and books. I also have an affinity towards early twentieth through mid-century European printmakers and have acquired the work of artists such as Käthe Kollwitz and Joan Miró.Close up of one of Peter’s ink-based drawings with collaged vintaged USGS maps.Currently my wife and I have been seeking out local Bay Area artists to incorporate into our collection. Some of our favorite pieces are an amazing Aaron Rosenstreich silver gelatin print of the deconstruction of the Bay Bridge, an intricately embroidered pelvic bone in a vintage frame by Marin Camille Hood, a Jeremy Fish lithograph of an animal totem, a sensual black and white cave-scape painting by Lindsey Lyons, and a quiet Jennifer Brandon photograph of a composition of string and foam. We just purchased a bright abstract of an Oakland waterfront loading crane by Mike Kimball that really has activated our front hallway space.Close up of “Wip Series #1” in Peter’s Oakland studioWhy is art important to you?Art can take you to a place so far away from the work-a-day mundane into a realm of thought, imagination and contemplation.
