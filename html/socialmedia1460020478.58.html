KikMost adults haven’t even heard of Kik but it’s the most used social media platform by FAR. Kik is the messaging platform. I’ve seen a lot of tech reporters talk about how teenagers use Snapchat, WhatsApp and a number of other messaging platforms but most teens my age haven’t even heard about those. Kik has a special feel to it. It feels like it was made for us, and us only.
