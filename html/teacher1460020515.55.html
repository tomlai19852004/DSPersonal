My teacher didn’t show up today … it was the best lesson ever.I was running late to my spin class this morning. Ugh. Tardy as can be, I race into the spin class room prepared for the ‘welcome to the classy, lazy jackass’ looks from everyone else. But when I arrived . . .. . . there was no teacher. Dark room. No music. A full class of 30 students wondering if they’re about to swap a sweaty 60-mins-of-agony hall pass for a first class ticket straight to boozy brunch. (I literally overheard a fellow student say that.)This gentleman, who has clearly taken a spin class or two in his life, said he could probably get us started until the MIA instructor gets there. Enter rally leader #1.Our knight in shining sweatpants, aka the spinning instructor stand-in, started class. Without music.Hold up. Let’s level set. I’m not sure if you’ve ever taken a spin class but they’re not exactly a walk in the park. They’re great and an amazing workout, but no music = no bueno. Spin class without music is the equivalent of H-E double hockey sticks (L-L).In the midst of our silence, I stepped off my bike and proceeded to the front of the class with my head held high and my most confident techie DJ iPhone abilities in hand. I turned on my iPhone flashlight and started pushing power buttons on this giant (5 ft tall) stack of music equipment like it was my job. I hold my breath and suddenly my New Year’s Eve 2013 Spotify playlist starts blastin’. Score! Imagine Dragons, turnt up to 11.The stadium crowd roar, of 30 people, is deafening. We’re in business, folks! No boozy brunch for anyone yet.Then another fellow student figures out how to turn on the black lights. Enter spin club scene. We see each other and quickly see another student figure out how to turn on the fans. Boom.Loudest class I’ve ever attended. We spin like we’ve never spun before. A collective we can figure anything out energy fills the room. Hootin’ and a’ hollering. Best spin class ever.Today’s Lessons:1. Teamwork makes the dream work. (Sometimes people are still literally dreaming while this happens. Not sure if the MIA instructor overslept but it’s entirely possible and happens to the best of us.)2. The most unexpected folks can be the most impactful leaders.3. If our knight in shining sweatpants didn’t step up to the spin podium and lead the class there would have been nobody else who would have followed. No music, lights, air circulation or attendance.4. Always have a ‘cool’ emergency iPhone playlist ready to rock. It was a little embarrassing when my Garth Brooks, ‘Unanswered Prayers’ came on during our sprint sesh. Other than that, my playlist was golden.5. WE need to CREATE more of this leadership and energy in our world. This was a simple spin class, we didn’t change the world, but it changed my world. The power to rally is something to be reckoned with.
