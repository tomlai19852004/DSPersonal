In the process, Mrs. Davis says she had the most fun she’s ever had teaching, and she re-discovered the magic of working from a child’s perspective. Imagination and make-believe became essential components of the curriculum. Parents and colleagues took notice too. Students went home and turned their bunk beds into pirate ships. Engagement and attendance increased and students in other classes were eager to join.“Anytime a teacher is being more playful in front of kids, she’s giving them permission to do the same,” said Jill Vialet, the CEO of Playworks, which works to improve recess around the country. “Play brings out the very best in every kid — it’s how they learn, how they experience the world, how they figure out who they are.”In this short video, Medium travels to the Pacific Northwest to explore what Nancy Davis’ experience can tell us about the ethos of public education and the power of play.Director/DP/Editor: Lena Jackson.
