It’s no coincidence that Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba — the company with the most successful IPO ever — was first a teacher.At root, the early-stage CEO and teacher share an unquenchable drive to create deep value for humans. They have a unique, inspired vision that they need to share, be it with children or consumers.Collectively, we are doing a tremendous job honoring and supporting our early-stage CEOs. Indeed, as an increasingly start-up and entrepreneur-obsessed culture, we’re coming to recognize CEOs as conductors of our culture’s creative progress.But we still have a disturbingly long way to go until our teachers feel that society is rooting for them. Teachers — the people who are taking care of our most important asset, the people who come to work each day with a task equal in so many ways to our CEOs — do not feel that we are behind them.While we pay lip service to the importance of education and the nobility of teachers, we don’t come close to offering them the concrete manifestations of honor that we afford our CEOs.Luckily, being a teacher — like being a start-up CEO — is profoundly fulfilling independent of compensation and status. Luckily so, because the job can be lonely and humbling. It puts a mirror in front of you that you can’t avoid. It requires that you understand your unique vision and that you fight tooth and nail to pass this vision on to the world, day in and day out.Even so, every bit of support from the outside helps. Every cheer matters. Every dollar — the most concrete manifestation of our collective respect — makes it more likely that each of our teachers becomes better and better, that our great teachers stay teachers, and that our great students at least consider becoming great teachers.Cover photo: Getty ImagesBright is made possible by funding from the New Venture Fund, and is supported by The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
