More cool architecture.Another beautiful child care facility…This first one is the Copenhagen Center for Cancer and Health by Nord Architects. I wasn’t able to access the inner courtyard which is very different than you’d expect (google it), but the outside is pretty excellent on its own merits.The form continues behind the building to a small recreational area for visitors.This is the Forfatterhuset Kindergarten by COBE Architects. Danish kids are said to be the luckiest creatures on the planet, and it’s hard to argue with that when you see how much great architecture is dedicated to ensured they grow up happy and healthy.Simply executed but great overall effect.Another look at the great Brutalist university building.And finally, some well-designed bike parking.Thanks for following along with our trip. We hope it was interesting for you.
