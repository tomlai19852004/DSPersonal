Architecture &amp; the moviesThere are only a few motion pictures out there with architectural backdrops as profound and vividly moving as the scenes themselves are — the output scenes so strong -that they linger around in our psyche and senses for a long time .We at Huzzpa love movies interpolated with good architecture , and being in love one explores deep and we exactly did that !! Hidden inside the movies we found parallel universes in the form of architecture reading out their celluloid stories -photographically , a few hidden and cryptic , a few fluid , some of them overpowering — but all of them immensely profound . Let's Discover , re-discover — let's freeze those moving frames in time and space laced with good architecture and appreciate them for their sheer depth of character , beauty , intrigue .Let's start with “ Last Year at Marienbad” . The plot revolves around a man insisting to a woman that they have know each other from before , the drama unfolds in a dramatic chateau hotel -Its story woven around austere visual architecture .The film is an architectural exploration of a memory , held as a shared space between two people — finding itself framed in a splendid Munich palatial resort .All along , almost perpetually the camera makes endless love with the sumptuous spaces and the ornate ceilings when not panning on the labyrinthine endless passages and corridors.The Acoustics brilliantly capture and project the dialogues and muffled voices from behind the walls — the conversation themselves don’t seem scripted, and we hear the points of intersection and dislocation in them.Amidst all the yearnings , passion play , fantasy , lust and love , the statues in the extensive corridors remain frozen — yet observing , perhaps waiting for the moments — the aristocratic guest turn into statue themselves .The camera transverses through endless hallways never distinguishing between chanel clad characters and the ornate walls panning on the Baroque.. ceilings-projecting ethereal infinite spaces which can be touched optically but not touched.. Elegant spaces equally anxious, ambiguous, distorted, conflicting, limitless as the film's protagonist.We loved the intrigue so much that we made a quiz out of it . Find it here .
