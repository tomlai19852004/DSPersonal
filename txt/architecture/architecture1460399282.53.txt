Tech, Architecture and Human Centered DesignMany architecture schools place students in protected environments dissociated from reality.In those environments students usually identify good or successful design based on very generic metrics, some of which are purely design principles (balance, contrast, composition etc..), but that’s such a designer’s way of critiquing design, in the real world design will be evaluated outside this scope, I think designers need to learn to stop being designers during their process, and be the person they’re designing for.Many architecture schools fail to communicate that to students, it almost becomes so easy to think that we as designers/architects are designing for architects, weather through the relationship that we have with our instructors, which in many cases tends to incline towards seeking validation, or through our discussions with peers and the feedback they give us.Of course there have been many schools of architecture that tried to re-invite the human-centered design approach into architecture, but I feel like that has recently been out-shined by Starchitecture, with users mistaking their needs for their desires to have the next Starchitect building in their city rather than a much needed public building that costs much less.I don’t have anything against beautiful buildings that are pushing the limits of the architecture and construction industry, I am just trying to perceive that from the perspective of a human-centric design advocate.I think we’re in a very interesting time where architecture and buildings are being treated like fashion more than any other time before, Instagram has created (maybe just amplified) a brand of architecture that is photographed to stir envy and communicate pride, one that defines impressions of an architectural piece based on how it looks solely, and that has never happened on this mainstream level before. This “architecture of show-off” has always been there, but with social media everyone has become an architectural photographer with the ability to communicate their programmed admiration towards it.As a designer in the tech industry, I have seen a serious difference in the design process, product designers today are learning to refer to user-centric design strategies, because no one really wants to design a product that no one wants to use, it’s pointless for an industry that is driven mostly by sales.I find that to be relevant in architecture too, and I think it should be the basis of architectural education. Architecture students must learn to use user and market research more often in their design process rather than just relying on their study of sensory site forces and design constraints.But perhaps things are starting to change, below is one of my favorite TED Talks about architecture, as this architect describes the opportunities social media is creating for us as designers and architects, tech is bringing to architecture the chance of closing the feedback loop with rapid responses, iteration and prototyping, helping us create more successful, competent and desirable buildings, products and experiences.Note: this is a post that I’m sharing as part of the effort I’m taking towards being less of a perfectionist; excuse any inaccurate expressions, typos or grammar errors as I only allowed myself to go over it twice to proofread it.Follow me on Twitter here
