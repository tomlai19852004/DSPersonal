Contemporary Architecture in a Collegiate Sphere.Recently we’ve seen a movement in architecture that takes element of the modern contemporary movement alongside older architecture to create a clever contrast in old spaces. This can be seen in cities through art museums or other spaces that benefit from having an atmosphere influenced by their architecture. However, only a few years ago Western Washington University took one of their older buildings (Miller Hall) and installed a contemporary enclosed sitting area for its students in the buildings former courtyard.The new construction effectively creates continuity while distinguishing the original structure from this new space by creating a gap with open air between the walkway of the hall and the new addition. The gap also holds a small and well kept garden of clover and an ivy wall as an allusion to the Western’s location in the Pacific Northwest. The enclosure also makes use of glass walls to give a duality of observer and observed.This truly inspired work is not only a beautiful and thought provoking, it’s also incredibly practical. The area is designed to be both a common place for students and a small cafeteria simultaneously, however in doing so it loses none of it’s atmosphere or appeal. Something very few locations dominated by student activities can accomplish.Overall this is one the most beautiful modern updates to older architecture I’ve been able to experience thus far. The flow and ease of the area has inspired my artistic mind as I’m sure it has anyone else who thinks in the same way.
