Responsive Architecture in the HomeHow will responsive architecture change the home?Two of the first questions that comes to mind are; in what ways will the home react to situations and the atmosphere and what do we want the home to be able to react to for a higher return on life?Possible scenarios I see arriving sooner than later;2. Temperature and Weather — for cooling and heating in all atmospheres and climates depending on the amount of guests or residents within a home and what they feel like (possibly communicated through a wearable device or sensors)Buildings That Breathe | Doris Sung’s Living Architecture:3. Cleaning, Coming Home, Activities —Alongside from defense, security, and temperature, there’s clearly room for sensors to grow and digify the home in ways we haven’t thought of and that data will open our eyes to, which Reform does a great job of explaining here.Via Reform:I see management of responsive architecture evolving into control by resident users via smart phone and/or augmented reality glasses that may save preferences or preset customizations, “work mode”, “fitness mode”, “cleaning mode” [which could push furniture back to get into tight spaces and release robotic cleaners etc], “entertainment mode” and on from there.Any of the strenuous or menial tasks that are repeated often throughout the home will likely be automated and in many cases, utilize responsive architecture to increase efficiency and reach.On the other side of responsive architecture, we have the capability to now improve the home and its functionality and entertainment ability in new and unexplored ways that we will certainly pay close attention to.
