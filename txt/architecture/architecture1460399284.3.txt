A story of Danish architecture.The Rundtarn also happens to have a gallery shooting off from its side. It must be occupying the story above the churchâ€¦ In any case they were showing an exhibition of Danish architectural drawings and models from the past 150-ish years. They were broken into seven categories (basic typologies like residential, prisons, schools, etc.). I was impressed with so many of them. A few of these are from Arne Jacobsen.
