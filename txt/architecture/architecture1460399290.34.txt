Architecture for the PicturesqueIn the early 17th century, the practice of architecture began to shift in London. The origin of the Greek word arkhitekton, “master builder”, from the act of building to solely design. Architecture became a purely intellectual practice of drawing and intellectual ideas. To be an architect was to stay within specific intellectual circles, separated from the real world.The Picturesque movement that followed revolted against this belief. They believed that architects must go out and visit their sites in order to design in order to be a part of nature. It was a romantic belief that building should be embedded into the landscape. Architectural drawings began to look more like paintings with the building as a backdrop in the landscape. The buildings themselves were built that way.This movement was known as Empericism. The belief that the architecture stems from the experiential. They believed architects placed too much emphasis on the visual aspects and should engage in the other senses as well. Experience should be placed over perception.I believe this debate is still going on today. Many architects are still designing for the perfect image as John Nash had. Many spaces are designed not for the user but for the photograph. In an information heavy time of Instagram, architectural photography has taken priority over experience.There is something to be learned on both sides of the debate. Both sides have valid arguments but in a time of excess information I believe we cam learn from the empiricists. Architects should find a larger voice that engage in relevant issues that are important in society.
