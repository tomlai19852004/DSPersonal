A whimsical structural playgroundThe entertainment district has some fascinating architecture. We believe these structures hold some type of bar or club, only open at night, they are designed to attract attention, with the hopes of filling seats on one of the many floors.Also, if you are hitting a creative wall and need some futuristic spaceship inspiration, or if youâ€™re Luc Besson and working on a new film, this is probably the place you want to explore at night.The fascinating thing is that all these buildings are very narrow and all directly next to each other.
