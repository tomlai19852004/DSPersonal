Starting from Microservices ArchitectureInstead of building a single monstrous, monolithic application, the idea is to split the application into set of smaller, interconnected services.A service typically implements a set of distinct features or functionality, such as order management, customer management, etc. Each microservice is a mini-application that has its own hexagonal architecture consisting of business logic along with various adapters. Some microservices would expose an API that’s consumed by other microservices or by the application’s clients.
