Jess is the sm-artistI am lucky enough to work with some flipping talented humans at Cerebra. One of those humans has a slight obsession with all things dog, but because she is so ridiculously loaded with talent, she draws and paints a lot of other cool stuff too. Her name is Jess Jardim-Wedepohl and she is the best.What I love the most about Jess’ art is that each piece has so much personality and you can’t help but wonder what happens to each little character next! Some of my personal favourites (in no particular order) are from her #Inktober 2015 illustration collection, namely ‘Ghost-dog’, ‘Floaty Pooch’ and ‘Feminist Freda’ (a birthday present for Martha — another of our lovely designers).Another firm favourite series is one that our whole team has had a hand in creating — the Album Cover series. This derived from some of the more hilarious statements made by pretty much anyone in the office that could be mistaken for being some sort of indie band name. Hence the beautiful, somewhat crude, ‘Panty Hamster’, ‘70’s Porn Cop’ and ‘Seriously Awesome Pigeons’ to name a few. Each complete with sassy intro’s and smash-hit singles.Of course you already love her stuff, so lucky you that Jess is exhibiting and selling her art this Saturday at the Heineken Next level Bar at 155 Smit Service Rd, Johannesburg.Go, be amazed. Get some art. Say hi to Jess.
