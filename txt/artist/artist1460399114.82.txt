Every culture or subculture has its cliches. Tortured artist is one of those cliches.I have the tortured background of the artist cliches. I was emotionally abused by my mum growing up. I was diagnosed with learning disabilities at eight. I probably had my generalised anxiety disorder from childhood. By fifteen I had depression. I have a binge eating disorder (not bulimia). At nineteen I had a bad fall and glandular fever. That was was the beginning of my physical chronic illness. By twenty-four I had rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.I can make art about all these subjects but it is doesnâ€™t make it better art. Only practice makes art better.
