I love the saturated colours and flat look to the images, which appear almost like 2D digital landscapes.@rosie_mathesonRosie’s feed is full of beautiful, gentle portraiture of the young generation shot on film. It’s inspiring to see photographers still using film today!@bryanschutmaatMost of you will know Bryan Schutmaat’s name, but did you know that he’s also on Instagram? It’s always great to see the snapshots and day-to-day interests of the big names in photography.@cianobasmithCian is one of my favourite emerging young photographers using film, who works with some fascinating and intriguing subjects like his latest ‘Tory Island’.
