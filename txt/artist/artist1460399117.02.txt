NYC ARTIST BRINGS DISNEY FEMALES UP TO DATE WITH A MODERN TWISTRoyalty like you’ve never seen before.Through many of our childhoods, Disney’s characters have been central and lasting figures that have stood the test of time. As years pass and generational styles and cultures change, we see differences in the characters of today and yesteryear. NYC born, Tampa based artist Joel Santana has decided to bridge the gap by giving the Princesses of Disney’s catalogue a classic pin-up twist with a modern, mainstream vibe.Santana has reinterpreted female leads and their counterparts as their tattoo artists (and in one case, both) and it is certainly a series for the ages. Unforgettable fan favorites such as Beauty and The Beast,Snow White, Alice In Wonderland and Aladdin have been reimagined for a wider, more mature audience.Joel is currently working on a new piece in the series which we can’t mention quite yet but you can follow him via his Instagram and Twitter pages as well as his Art Of Santana website.Prints and assorted accessories of all his pieces are available for purchase via the MadHatCo online store.Stay tuned for our interview with Joel Santana as he updates us on his upcoming projects and reveals which of the Disney Princesses will be the next muse for his super creative “Inked Princess” series.
