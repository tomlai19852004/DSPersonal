For the longest time I’ve written songs, over 100 songs, maybe more, it’s something I came into in high school when my heart was broken by a cute cheerleader I liked but never spoke to (story of my life).Over time, I began to focus more and more on my music and learned better singing techniques, took music lessons, worked on lyrics, rhymes, expanding my vocabulary, trying to find my own voice. It was fun.But music has been a challenge, being that the majority of my songs, although stemming from a heart for God are not worship songs so I couldn’t sing them in church per say.So for a year or so, I tried to get out there and play shows which I did to some success but music takes money and I was unemployed for about a year so I had to stop recording and gigging, I was putting in too much time and getting no money out of it. Thankfully God provided a part time pastoring job at a beautiful church in Santa Ana that’s been very fulfilling and so now that life is a bit more settled, music is making a comeback.So music is making a comeback and what does that mean?It means striking up the band, having my son play drums (a dream come true, thank you Van Halen) and pulling in a couple of guys that seem to enjoy my songs. My short term dream is to play at Downtown Disney this summer or Fall and have all of YOU guys come and support us, my long term dream is to play large shows in front of thousands of people.But the doubt remains, I’m too old, my songs aren’t that good, my voice is not good enough, I still have no money, this will just be a waste of time. That could all be true, but what drives me? The simple love of music, that’s what drives me, the belief that a simple melody and gorgeous lyrics can truly change someone’s life and the fact that for some reason, whether I like it or not, God has given me this skill to write songs so I must keep at it.I wonder what artistic dream you have that you’re needing to pursue, I wonder how it all began, your up’s and down’s which are many I’m sure, and where you’re at today.I want to encourage you, put yourself out there again, stop looking at your past failures and pursue your dream. It’s not about how many people show up, listen or like your songs, of course that’s the goal, but you have to settle on thing in your heart RIGHT NOW— will you do it even if nobody comes?That’s the main question, once you settle that in your heart, fame and fortune may or may not come, but it won’t matter, because your heart will be in the right place.May your creativity and passion find its way forward, and may it bless you and the heart of God, as well as a few thousands people along the way.Thanks so much for being here,Until next time,Your #GOZO! friend,davidTrigHope you enjoyed reading this.
