Spotlight On: Clay Randle The Artist/Writer aka CIDLike this:RelatedSpotlight On: Clay Randle The Artist/Writer aka CIDI became acquainted with artist/writer/music manager Clay Randle in 2011 when he sent me some music with a request to listen to, and possibly review or feature, the band he was representing.I was writing for DJ Come of Age and his Soul Music of The World back then, as well as blogging on the first incarnation of The Moxie Bee.I listened and wrote back to tell him the songs he’d sent were too derivative of other rappers/hip-hop groups.I told him what I heard was promising, but needed more “cooking”.I was impressed with Clay because instead of responding with rudeness or hurt feelings, or not responding at all, as some others who’d sent me music had done, he wrote back to say, “Next time I’ll send you something better.”And he did.Years later Clay Randle is still creating art, writing and music, on his own and in art/music collectives.Today he’s sharing a sampling of his visual/prose hybrid art.About The Artist/Writer:Atom Used To Live Here is a literary gallery curated by artist , Clay Randle ; creatively known as CID.
