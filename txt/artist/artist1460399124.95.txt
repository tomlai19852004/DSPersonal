You are an ArtistWas at the Picasso museum in Barcelona a few weeks ago. The experience deeply influenced me. I saw how he was not afraid to deconstruct and then reinvent his art over the course of his life. I saw the way he dared. I saw his devotion to excellence — and being an outright original. Picasso has inspired me.So here’s what I think. At work each day, we are all artists. My brushes and paints happen to be my words. My canvas is my books and the audiences I have the privilege to share my leadership message with. But I’m an artist. I honestly feel that. I create. I express. I provoke. And so can you.Each day you step into the place where you work, you have the opportunity to nurture — and awaken — the artist that inhabits you. We all have a core craving to express who we are and to create something special. Part of being human. I encourage you to satisfy that urge by being the Picasso of Human Resources or the Dali of Sales. Be the Renoir of Real Estate or the Michelangelo of Medicine.Step out into the world each day and create your masterpiece. The world will be better for it.RobinFollow Robin Sharma on Twitter &amp; Instagram.Grab a free eBook The Little Black Book of Stunning Success.
