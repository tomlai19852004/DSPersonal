BBuzzArt — The Gateway to Success for Emerging ArtistsBBuzzArt Co. Ltd. has launched BBuzzArt version two service on Oct. 2015, which is an art social platform for emerging artists and art enthusiasts around the world. Upon launch, it immediately received strong attentions from prospective users and around 3,000 works of art from talented emerging artists were uploaded and presented within 3 weeks without any paid promotional efforts.Emerging artists have long been alienated from the art industry. Just recently, numerous initiatives were developed to support and to acknowledge young artistic creators but these efforts are extremely limited to only a handful of them. What is even more surprising is that every year around 3 million new graduates majored in art related disciplines are tapping the industry due to the proliferation of art institutions around the world.It takes long and lonesome time for them to be matured as professional artists after completing the academic career. During this period, many of them are trapped in the isolation and end up giving up their artistic career because of financial problem and lack of emotional support. Although their financial problem can be somewhat relieved by having part-time jobs, the emotional instability and limited promotional channels seem difficult to overcome on their own. Good news to such a devastating reality, BBuzzArt can turn the situation upside down!At BBuzzArt, emerging artists can freely share their artistic outcomes, completed and in process, with ideas and inspirations behind and receive feedback from other artists and art enthusiasts around the world. There are two ways to leave a feedback: one with typing own words and the other with BBuzzArt Feedback Aide. BBuzzArt Feedback Aide is a tool that automatically generates a feedback once a user selects three adjectives that best describe a particular art work. It is a simple and convenient way to express the feeling and opinion on art works by avoiding mundane comments. In short, BBuzzArt is a global online community for those who create, search and enjoy art!“We are absolutely surprised by the number of artistically charged creators at BBuzzArt and pleased to fulfill their needs by providing a sense of community as well as promotional channel. Also, we serve the need of art lovers seeking and appreciating new art and idea. The feedback, either professional or emotional, is a critical trace of one’s interest towards emerging artists and we definitely believe that the future masterpiece starts with your feedback!” said Clara Shin, CEO and Co-Founder of BBuzzArt.From online to offline, BBuzzArt starts BBuzzArt Global Traveling Exhibition, also called as BBuzzShow, from January 2016 to give an exhibition opportunity to emerging artists. BBuzzShow will be open in Singapore, Shanghai, Vienna, Berlin, New York, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, Tokyo and Seoul in 2016.BBuzzArt Co. Ltd. is a software startup specialized in visual arts.
