If you are current on trends in world news and international public health, you might surmise that his untimely passing is basically due to not owning a Fitbit. No pressure, esteemed daughter, but your motherâ€™s birthday is in three days. Consider buying the model with the heart rate monitor.Yours Faithfully,Dr. BabaTO: HilalFROM: DadSUBJECT: Fax machine down, use satellite messaging insteadHello Dear,A quick update to inform you that your brother has now successfully purchased a legal and authenticated Fitbit, transferring funds to the Target Corporation, Cherry Hill, New Jersey retail branch. Telex: 6731689. The deal was finalized at 17:00 hours. Please consider using your transferred funds to purchase something else, perhaps one of those NutriBullet things as your motherâ€™s on this weird health kick lately.Yours in Krishna,DadThanks for the ðŸ’› Medium!!
