Street artistsI’ve always been fascinated about art in public spaces. Whether it is street musicians’ plays, graffiti art or random flashmobs, there is something really noble about the people who share their art in the streets. Yes, many times the intention is to purely make money; however, none of the passersby are discriminated if they don’t carry cash with them. And as one of the street performers on Times Square in New York said: “If you don’t carry cash on you — we understand: there’s an ATM right around the corner.” Whenever I get a chance I try to interact with these vivid individuals who basically bright up everyone’s daily routine. Below are some photos and videos of street artists in action.Enjoy!Next time you pass near street artists, please share a smile with them (and, if you can, a dollar).Thank you.P.S. If you liked what you’ve read and seen so far I think you’ll like this video that I filmed in New York.
