The artist becomes bigger than the art he or she creates. Part 1.Before the modern era selling art was different than it is now. In the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance, royal or rich people ordered art. A king would ask for a certain painting of his family or a musical play for at his daughter’s wedding. They knew what they wanted and ordered what they wanted. They negotiated with an artist for how much he would be paid, what kinds of materials would be used, how long it would take to complete, and what the subject of the work would be.Artists didn’t have the same artistic freedom as now, but it did have its positive side. You didn’t make something and then just hope it would sell, the way artists often do now.In the Middle Ages the artist was someone who worked with his/her hands. They were considered skilled in their job. This was something that Renaissance artists wanted to change. They wanted to be considered as thinkers and innovators. That was the beginning of the change in status of the artist. They could become a ‘star’ and people would buy the art because it was made by that ‘star’ and not because they particularly loved the art or ordered the art.
