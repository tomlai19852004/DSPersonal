Have You Seen Me? A Memorial to Slavery. Artist Talk &amp; Kickstarter PartyPittsburgh artist Alexi Morrisey is in the final 2 weeks of funding for his Kickstarter project for “Have You Seen Me? A Memorial to Slavery.” One of the reasons I think this project is worth a look is that it brings together several different types of story telling medias — milk bottles, advertising, oral history — to tell a story.One of the many interesting things about this project is that it uses the 1980’s “kid on the milk carton” to create a memorial to slavery:You have not one, but two chances to meet the artist, and learn more about the project in person this week. I am including the Kickstarter video below, but if you have some time on Tuesday or Friday, come meet Alexi and see his work in person.Artist Talk: Alexi Morrissey will give an overview of his art practice and discuss in detail his most recent project “Have You Seen Me?” Tuesday, July 7, 7pm @ Pittsburgh Filmmakers on Melwood Free, please RSVP on Facebook“Have You Seen Me?” Fundraiser Party Friday, July 10, 7–10pm @ Union Pig &amp; Chicken Free, please RSVP on FacebookMorrisey is originally from Boston but has been living and working in Pittsburgh for the past 2 decades. His work has been exhibited nationally and internationally. You can read more about his 2010 Artist Residency at the New Hazlett Theater in this Q &amp; A from Pop City Media.As of today, “Have You Seen Me?” is only 38% funded, with 11 days to go. Each bottle is a limited edition and the milk bottles will sell for $400 and up after the Kickstarter campaign. There are a handful of bottles left at the $300 level. If $300 is bit much for your art budget this year, Morrisey has some prints of the bottle logo designs starting at $25.Follow the project on Facebook &amp; Twitter @MilkBottleProj.Kickstarter Page: http://kck.st/1Usk8HkProject Website: milkbottleproject.comOriginally published at iheartpgh.com on July 6, 2015.
