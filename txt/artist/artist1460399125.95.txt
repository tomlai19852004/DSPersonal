Are You An Artist?I remember having a discussion with a long time friend. He had been working for a while as a Human Resources Insights Specialist at a large company.This means that he would study people that worked for his company and try to understand what makes them successful in their jobs. He would then try to find ways to replicate the things he learned, making all the people that worked at the company more successful.During our discussion, he showed me a dashboard that he had created to help him in his job. The dashboard was ugly. It was an eclectic mix of spreadsheets and an odd collection of widgets.I had to stop him right there and chastise him. “How can you say you are not creative? What you are showing me here is exceptionally creative!”I explained to my friend that people who draw pictures are not the only creative people in the world. Creativity is not something that only a select few can tap into.I love the way Seth Godin approaches this idea. He goes even further, claiming that people are not just creative, but ARTISTS!I love that.This short article is an example of what I call a “Note.” I send notes to a few thousand people every Thursday morning. Visit travisneilson.com/notes to sign up for that.Occasionally I post the note here on Medium. Today I’m testing out the “Letters” feature on Medium. Let me know what you think :)
