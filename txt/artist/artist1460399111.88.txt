After reading your post, I thought about if we are asking the fans too much in doing multiple things for us, but then I realized that crowdfunding is by far the most effective way for them to support us.After realizing this, I donâ€™t think we are asking too much from the fans. Instead, we are removing many interval steps for them to reach us.Hope this helps!
