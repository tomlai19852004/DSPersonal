Lord Help Us. The Artists are Armed.Like this:DO NOT challenge us. You who think we are nothing more than scribblers. You who think we are nothing more than makers of random patterns. Do Not challenge us.We are not just writers, painters, designers, graphic artists or photographers. We are the fuel for great revolutions.Our one single orchestra of words, colours, patterns, lines or shapes can evoke an uprising of unimaginable magnitude.We are not just sculptors, architects, programmers, or engineers. We are the creators of unparalled mischief and mayhem.Our one single sketched out concept, program or layout can give mere men great ways to challenge your authority.We do not fear misery or punishment. We are the strugglers and believers. We follow our dreams till the ends of the world.And do not think death can stop us. We are the true immortal beings. Our creations shall keep us alive.There are no superheroes. There are only artists who’ve raised their pens against.Like Loading…Originally published at penscribble.wordpress.com on August 4, 2015.
