I looked into the eyes of the Artist, he was misting over, tears were visible, he could not believe he did not sell one painting. He knew that there was a Gallery charge for no sales and I watched him count off the money.I felt so sorry for him, his work was good, yet with all the promotion we did, nothing sold.His disappointment started at the opening, the two celebrity guests failed to arrive, some excuses, and he was visibly devastated that they did not come. A friend filled in for the opening but there was a real sense of lack.The show opened and closed without a sale and now after all the expense of producing the show, canvas, art materials, frames, transportation to the Gallery from far away, the cost of the Artist reception and he now stood there counting off the Gallery charge for no sales.He was prepared to pay it, he never asked for discount or complained about no sale, I admired that, no excuses, just pay the man.He offered me the money, I said “ No, you keep it.”He just looked so hurt and he put the money away, collected his paintings and prepared to leave.The Gallery staff looked at me and asked why I did not take the money, they are all young, I said, “You have to taste failure to understand how devastating it is, he is hurt enough without us adding to his pain, he is a nice guy.”Before he left he asked me what he had done wrong?I said,” Nothing, the problem is you are unknown, the curse of the Artist.”I told him to go home and build a following in his own city before he tries again in a big city like Manila and get a presence on line where people can get to know you, its all about getting peoples attention.You may ask, why did I have this show?I inherited it. It was arranged before my services were engaged.This really is an example of what happens so often, big dreams not quite thought out properly and it leads to rejection and disappointment and that horrible word, failure.I do not want to see this happen to any Artist, the art business is hard enough without this kind of devastation. I know what it feels like to fail and I hope that this Artist can pull through this, this only happened a few months ago and I have not heard from him.Lessons to be learned from this show?+ Do not try to have a large one man show where you are unknown, it is a difficult ask.+ Build your personal following before you attempt that big show in the big Gallery.I know people will not like me saying this but, “if you are unknown, then you are unknown.”+I talk so much about Facebook, emails, blogs, story telling and just meeting people and making strangers into collectors and then friends, you have to do it.+ Galleries are not miracle workers and yes we have lots of collectors who like to see most shows but if they do not know you, as I said its a difficult ask, get attention, get known, that is your responsibility.This is just a few thoughts about Artists, not on the business side and how to connect with people.Artists take care of yourself, this can be a brutal business as I just described.Make sure you have network around you of loving caring friends so when it all goes wrong, and in this industry it can very easily, you have caring people to talk to and share with, that love you.A lot of Artists suffer from depression and have some very negative thoughts, if you do, get help. Please, get help.I went through depression and I did not get help straight away but when I did it all turned around. Artist,+Be gentle on yourself.+Talk about your dreams and struggles.+We want all Artists to be successful, not only materially but also emotionally.+Rejection is a bitter pill, try to not take it personally, I know that is a big ask, smile and remember, you cannot please everyone.As I used to say, “Smile them off, don’t react.”I know this post is not as instructive as most of my posts, but I really do care about Artists whose dreams get shattered, that’s why I want to give value back to Artists, because when I needed help an Artist was there for me.I am very grateful for all for the nice comments my posts get, I hope this is a help to someone.Keep smiling, it drives the critics crazy.Mark Shellshear.Art consultant.[email protected]/*  */
