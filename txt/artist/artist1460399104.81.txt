I am raised and trained by an award-winning pioneering artist, so early on in life I realized I am most free when I am breaking boundaries not just as a dancer, but as an artist — I realized I am avant garde in my thinking.I created [anything] out of my own thoughts or ideas rather than the influence of others and that was, is and has been my truth. I am freedom when I am carving a path not yet made. I am native me most when I am freedom and thus I am truth.What is your truth?http://AMRAPALIONLINE.COM
