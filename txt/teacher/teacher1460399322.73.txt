(I found out they use something called the Danielson rubrics, according to one teacher.)Essentially, what makes a teacher a good teacher is their ability to convey information to students and make them understand it. Additionally, they need to be able to check the understanding of the students (assignments, tests) and grade those papers in a timely fashion.So why are the qualities of using technology, making kids do group work, and writing objectives on the board directly affiliated with “good teacher?”This criteria adopted by the district/state (FL) doesn't accommodate different teaching styles. These rubrics and systems that are adopted are not necessarily the correct way to grade teachers. And neither is that one failing student in the class a reason to decrease the teacher’s salary.Just like kids have different learning styles, teachers have different teaching styles. They suit different learning styles with various degrees of effectiveness, because no student is set into simply one learning style. On top of that, different subjects are taught differently. A math teacher, for example, can effectively convey knowledge without using group work, while those techniques might work well in teaching English/Langauage Arts.Overall, what makes a teacher good is not only his/her skills, but also a receptive class. Observing the retention of information in the students and their ability to apply it in all types of assignments might be a better gauge for teacher efficiency.It’s extremely upsetting to see my teachers — the good ones — fake their teaching style on observation day or get a low score, while my worst teachers manage to score well on the audits.
