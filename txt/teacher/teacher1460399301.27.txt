TeacherI’m really struggling. I lost my job in November and I’m in the midst of trying to balance what I do with who I am.I wrote in January about the confusion I feel with identity. It’s even bigger now, with more questions than answers. Bill Ferriter was kind enough to leave a very wise comment for me:(That’s just a snippet, but it helps.)In May, I wrote more about being a teacher…what it means for identity and working. I still think that a teacher is a holistic undertaking — you don’t do teaching. You are a teacher. It’s unique in the sense that not many other professions can make the same claim.I think I had it right back in January — I need to stop defining myself by one quality. I may not be in a classroom, my expiration date may be past, but I’m inextricably wound up in education, regardless of what I do. Maybe that’s the real lesson.Originally published at blog.ohheybrian.com on December 11, 2014.
