How design teachers approach design in the classroomWe’re so proud to say that design schools around the world use InVision in their classrooms to teach students not only how to design, but how to communicate and work with a team.Since the fall semester just came to a close, we caught up with some of our favorite professors and lecturers and asked them to share their thoughts on how they approach design in the classroom.
