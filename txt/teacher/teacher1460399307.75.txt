I am a high school calculus teacher and I fight with my students to put their calculators away. I show them how to find ways of using the incredible power of their brain to solve problems. Pattern recognition is lost to our students when we simply place a calculator in their hands. With that being said, I also believe in rote memory at an early age. Too many students come to me with an inability to multiply single digits in their head without the aid of calculators or finger trickery. I am convinced that they only reason children struggle with mathematics is that we try too hard to have students understand the “Why” of math before they can master the “DO” of math. When children are learning early on to read and write, we do not expect them to read and analyze Shakespeare, or to write a persuasive essay on the evils of reality TV in our modern society. Common Core is fine, if it is a tool that is used in conjuction with the skills development. I believe that common core standards should slowly work themselves into the curriculum over the years of a student’s education.When my students are solving a 3 page problem in calculus, they need to rely on their rote memory as to not get distracted by finding alternative ways to find an answer they should be able to produce at any given moment.I can have my students memorize the quadratic formula for finding the roots of a quadratic, or I can show them how to derive that formula by completing the square on a standard quadratic. Honestly, both need to be done. Students need to understand the origins of the quadratic formula, but when it comes time to take the ACT or the AP Calculus exam, they can’t spend that extra time deriving the quadratic formula to find roots.I like what you have to say, but I think common core needs to be introduced just like a gradient color blend. You start with black and slowly move to solid red, but in the interim, there are several shades of red and black
