As a pre-school teacher, and a mom, your story pushed so many of my buttons, on so many levels.I have had children in my English-medium class for whom english is a second language and not spoken at home.I have taught children whose parents are illiterate and cannot help them to learn their alphabet or to practice reading.I have taught children whose parents are members of Mensa, and have passed on the genius gene to them.I have taught children who can read and write at a jaw-droppingly early age.I have taught children who have never held a crayon or pencil.I have taught children who fit somewhere in between all of that.Most of them have been in the same class at the same time.It is my duty as an educator to create a balanced, safe, fulfilling environment so that all the children in my class could thrive.Maintaining a child’s belief in themselves is the key to everything else; to every lesson and accomplishment to come.It’s certainly not easy. In fact, it’s damn hard work.To me, it is pure laziness on the part of a teacher to expect the child to serve the syllabus and not the syllabus to serve the child.
