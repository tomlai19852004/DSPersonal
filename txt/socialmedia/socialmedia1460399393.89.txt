Their digital media team has a slick and efficient system in place to entertain and engage with fans on social media, using tools like Buffer. The results: The Broncos are one of the top teams in the entire NFL when it comes to social media.Here’s how they share.Ben Hunt, the Broncos’ Director of Digital Media, and Scott Ward, the team’s Social Media Coordinator, have an awesome system in place for sharing. And one of the keys is the way the digital media team comes together to get content ready to ship to fans on social media.The Broncos use Buffer’s team members feature to allow for others on the digital media team to contribute content to Twitter and Facebook. Eight people are currently on board with access, and Scott and Ben have the final approval on everything that goes out.The way team members works within Buffer, different people can have different permissions.Ben and Scott use this system as a way to efficiently add content to their queue: It saves Scott from having to create all the content all the time and instead allows him to share ready-made stuff in a single click.Another benefit is quality control. The team member functionality is an added step to ensure that the content is on point, accurate, grammatically correct, and all the little things are in place that make for a great social media update.The Broncos may share more than 20 social media updates per day (possibly even more on gameday when the team wins).How do they know which content is resonating most?In the absolute easiest way possible, Scott is able to quickly dive into Buffer analytics and see at-a-glance what’s working, simply by spotting any Top Tweet or Top Post tags.Whenever these tags appear, Scott knows that this post was a hit, getting more total engagement (perhaps from extra clicks or extra retweets) than a typical post. At that point, he can act right away by re-scheduling it to share again.To fill out the picture from the analytics side, the Broncos also rely on Rival IQ for advanced analytics on their own posts as well as how their fellow NFL teams are performing on social media.The Broncos — and all sports teams — have an interesting use case of social media scheduling: There’s a balance of live events and real-time news, coupled with the in-between times of sharing content with a different rhythm.Ben and Scott have found some neat ways to work within this duality.From Scott:The main schedule for the Broncos came about with a mix of research-backed data and personal results.The team started with an around-the-clock schedule of 24 posts on Twitter, one every hour.When the return from those late night tweets wasn’t quite as good, Scott went into research mode, checking out some of the posts on the Buffer blog even that share about the best times to post on Twitter as well as concepts like The Burrito Principle.This inspired the new schedule: Sharing the same 24 times per day but in a condensed way. Every post the Broncos schedule is now set for daytime hours in the U.S., beginning at 5:00 a.m. on the East Coast and stretching to 10:30 p.m. on the West Coast.The Broncos are also epic content creators. Their official team website has loads of articles, videos, and features that make ideal content to share on social media.And here’s the way they make sure it all gets out there.The Broncos use Buffer’s Feeds to tie in content from their online content channels right into the Buffer app.With Feeds, you can pull in up to 15 RSS Feeds per connected profile, and all that content fills in automatically and chronologically into the Feeds section of the app, from which point you can approve or dismiss with a single click.Scott finds that the Feeds system works great as a sort of checklist for seeing what’s been published and what’s been shared. It’s an inbox of sorts, constantly filling with new messages each time a new article is published.Due to the nature of pro sports, the Broncos’ digital media team is always on the move — either traveling back-and-forth from away games, heading down to press conferences or practices. It’s key that you’re able to take your social media sharing with you wherever you go.Ben, Scott, and the team have found this to be easily accomplished with the mobile version of Buffer (on iOS and Android).Here’s a picture of the full social media stack for the Broncos, all the tools that help them schedule and analyze content and see what’s working for their players, fans, and fellow NFL teams.Buffer — For social media scheduling, team management, and content distributionRival IQ — For competitive analysis and full context and data on their social media sharesWay In — For social data visualization and data discovery of the Broncos’s particular nicheEncore Alert — For keyword monitoring of Bronco-related topics, fans, and playersAdditionally, the Broncos have used Encore Alerts to spot new fans like UFC fighter Holly Holm, DJ Tiësto, actor Kate Hudson, NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion Kyle Busch and NBA All-star Paul George, just to name a few — all social media influencers who loves the Broncos and who the team might not have found out about without it.The Denver Broncos use Buffer for Business to manage their social media marketing, to engage their fans with timely content, and to stay connected as a team on social posting on-the-go.Join the Denver Broncos and 5,000+ other brands and business with a free trial of Buffer’s most powerful social media features!Image sources: Craig Hawkins, Pablo, Denver BroncosOriginally published at blog.bufferapp.com on December 17, 2015.
