Social Media 101Some people are just terrible at social media. Here are some tips of what NOT to do. And hey, look, I’m no expert. However I used to do social media as a living for official concert and festival accounts, so I suppose I do know a little something, but just use some common sense in this space. No one likes an idiot. Oh, and you don’t HAVE to take my advice… these are simply suggestions — but if you did, then your followers/friends will hate you just a little bit less. Also, I’m half joking here, so don’t read into this too much — but also read into it a lot.INSTAGRAMExample:TWITTERI.E. @FooFighters are playing at @TheRoxy in #LosAngeles right now and they sound great!By doing so, only your followers that are already following @foofighters will see that in their feed. You want to start the tweet using a regular word (or character) instead.A better tweet would be:I.E. Whoa, I’m seeing @FooFighters tonight at @TheRoxy in #LosAngeles and they sound great!FACEBOOKSNAPCHATAlright, there’s my rant. Hope that you enjoyed it.
